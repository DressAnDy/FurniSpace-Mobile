## 0. Role & access map

### 0.0 Role count and authorization model

The database seeder defines exactly **5 business roles**:

| Role | Main responsibility | Important scope rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CUSTOMER` | Submit projects, approve design/quotation/delivery, pay and review | Usually limited to resources owned by the current account |
| `SALES` | Intake, consultation, assignment, commercial and delivery coordination | Usually limited to assigned projects; some lists support team scope |
| `DESIGNER` | Measurement, proposal, room planner and customization design | Usually must be the project's assigned Designer |
| `PRODUCTION` | Customization feasibility, production execution and delivery operations | Usually must be assigned to the production request/schedule |
| `ADMIN` | Account/catalog administration, reporting, finance and workflow oversight | Not automatically allowed on customer-only actions |

An endpoint shared by several roles has one canonical contract:

1. This section indexes each role's APIs and end-to-end flow.
2. Sections 2–24 define request, response, filters, validation, enums, messages, errors and special cases.
3. Route authorization runs first; resource ownership/assignment/visibility rules run in Application services.

`401` means no valid session/token. `403` means authenticated but the role or resource scope is not allowed. A role listed on a route therefore does not guarantee access to every resource ID.

### 0.1 CUSTOMER

**Flow**

```text
Register/login -> create project -> complete information
-> review/select proposal -> review/accept quotation
-> complete delivery details -> pay deposit
-> follow production/delivery -> confirm delivery
-> pay remaining amount -> review/public consent
```

| Area | APIs available to CUSTOMER | Contract detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | Current profile/password/logout and `PATCH /accounts/me` | [Auth](#3-auth--auth), [Accounts](#4-accounts) |
| Projects | Create; list/detail/by-user; published proposal; basic information; target date; reopen; measurement gallery; own review | [Projects](#9-projects) |
| Proposals | Read proposals/scenes/items; `select-final`; `request-revision` | [Proposals](#10-proposals--scenes) |
| Room planner | Read scene; resolve referenced products/layout assets | [Room planner](#11-room-planner) |
| Quotations | List/detail; `accept`, `request-revision`, `reject` | [Quotations](#12-quotations) |
| Orders/delivery | List/detail/my orders; delivery details; deposit; deliveries; confirm; product issues | [Orders](#13-orders) |
| Customization | Read request/version; create request; accept feasible version; cancel | [Customization](#14-customization-requests) |
| Areas/schedules | Read allowed areas/images/schedules; update allowed status; request delivery change | [Areas](#15-project-areas), [Schedules](#16-project-schedules) |
| Files/chat/notification | Scoped project files, participant chats and own notifications | [Files](#17-project-files--shared-files), [Chat](#18-chat), [Notifications](#19-notifications) |
| Payments | Own list/detail/summary/status; attempts; cancel attempt; PayOS/SePay helpers | [Payments](#20-payments) |
| Portfolio/realtime | Review public consent; authorized hub groups | [Showcases](#23-portfolio--public-showcases), [SignalR](#22-signalr-hubs) |

**Cases to handle**

- Ownership checks can return `403` even when `CUSTOMER` is listed.
- Selecting a final proposal can auto-create a draft quotation; use returned `quotationId`.
- Accepting a quotation creates order `CREATED`; it does not settle the deposit.
- Delivery details lock after deposit settlement.
- Provider webhook, not return URL, confirms payment.
- Customer file access requires appropriate `FileVisibility`.

### 0.2 SALES

**Flow**

```text
Receive SUBMITTED project -> assign Sales/request information
-> create project-start fee if required -> assign Designer
-> coordinate proposal -> prepare/send quotation
-> coordinate deposit -> create/assign production request
-> schedule and monitor delivery -> prepare remaining payment
-> complete workflow -> prepare showcase
```

| Area | APIs available to SALES | Contract detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboard | Sales queue/KPIs and phase deadline risks | [Role dashboards](#20c-role-dashboards-queues--kpis) |
| Staff lookup | Available Designers and Production staff | [Accounts](#4-accounts), [Production](#21-production) |
| Projects | List/detail; assignments; information; basic info/target; status/reject/complete/reopen; workflow | [Projects](#9-projects) |
| Project start fee | Create fee and read eligibility/status | [Payments](#202-project-start-fee--apiprojects) |
| Proposals | Create/read/update/publish proposals/scenes and permitted items | [Proposals](#10-proposals--scenes) |
| Quotations | Draft, item financials, send, revise, cancel and read customer decision | [Quotations](#12-quotations) |
| Orders/delivery | Read; payment creation; production request; final payment; completion/delivery actions where listed | [Orders](#13-orders) |
| Production/delay | Read/assign Production requests and record operational delays | [Production](#21-production), [Delay reports](#13a-operational-delay-reports) |
| Schedules/areas/files | Manage allowed schedules, areas, project files and galleries | [Areas](#15-project-areas), [Schedules](#16-project-schedules), [Files](#17-project-files--shared-files) |
| Chat/payments | Assigned coordination chats and allowed payment reads/provider helpers | [Chat](#18-chat), [Payments](#20-payments) |
| Showcase | Create/edit/submit draft and manage media | [Showcases](#23-portfolio--public-showcases) |

**Cases to handle**

- Assignment checks can reject an unassigned Sales account.
- Project transitions must follow `ProjectStatusTransitionEvaluator`.
- Quotation item/header totals and VAT are server-calculated.
- Production request creation requires an eligible workflow and configured production deadline.
- Delivery start requires completed production, confirmed schedule and ready items.

### 0.3 DESIGNER

**Flow**

```text
Open assigned project -> measurement schedule/images/areas
-> browse eligible project catalog -> build proposal scenes
-> save room planner -> sync commercial furniture
-> publish/revise proposal -> design customization versions
-> coordinate with assigned Sales
```

| Area | APIs available to DESIGNER | Contract detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboard/projects | Designer queue/KPIs; assigned project list/detail and permitted status | [Dashboards](#20c-role-dashboards-queues--kpis), [Projects](#9-projects) |
| Project catalog | Eligible project products and versions | [Designer catalog](#8b-catalog--designer-project-catalog) |
| Product versions/assets | Create/upload allowed version assets; active layout asset catalog | [Product versions](#8-catalog--product-versions), [Layout assets](#8c-catalog--layout-assets) |
| Proposals/planner | Create/read/update/publish; scene/item sync; planner read/resolve/save | [Proposals](#10-proposals--scenes), [Room planner](#11-room-planner) |
| Customization | Create/edit/submit/withdraw design versions | [Customization](#14-customization-requests) |
| Areas/measurement | Create/update areas; upload/link measurement images | [Areas](#15-project-areas), [Schedules](#16-project-schedules) |
| Commercial read | Read Quotations/Orders where the action lists Designer | [Quotations](#12-quotations), [Orders](#13-orders) |
| Collaboration | Scoped files, Designer–Sales chat, notifications and payment reads | [Files](#17-project-files--shared-files), [Chat](#18-chat), [Payments](#20-payments) |

**Cases to handle**

- Most writes require `assignedDesignerId == currentUserId`.
- Project catalog excludes inactive and unrelated project-specific versions.
- Room planner schema v3 validates floor/area IDs, object families and active assets.
- Draft customization versions are hidden from other project viewers.
- Designer status transitions are more restricted than Sales/Admin transitions.

### 0.4 PRODUCTION

**Flow**

```text
Review customization feasibility -> receive assigned request
-> start request -> update item statuses -> report delay if needed
-> complete request -> coordinate delivery batches/schedules
-> expose completion for customer confirmation/final payment
```

| Area | APIs available to PRODUCTION | Contract detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboard | Production queue/KPIs and production deadline risks | [Role dashboards](#20c-role-dashboards-queues--kpis) |
| Customization | Global queue/detail and feasibility review | [Customization](#14-customization-requests) |
| Production | Request list/detail/start/complete, item status updates and unavailable-item queue | [Production](#21-production) |
| Orders/delivery | Read eligible orders; listed delivery batch actions | [Orders](#13-orders) |
| Schedules | Create/update/read allowed production/delivery schedules | [Schedules](#16-project-schedules) |
| Delay/issues | Production/delivery delay evidence and product issue reads | [Delay reports](#13a-operational-delay-reports), [Orders](#13-orders) |
| Collaboration | Assigned Production chat, scoped files and own notifications | [Chat](#18-chat), [Files](#17-project-files--shared-files) |

**Cases to handle**

- `start` only accepts a pending request; server owns actual start time.
- Complete requires every item to be `COMPLETED` or `CANCELLED`.
- Cancelled Production items map Order items to `UNAVAILABLE`; this is not a financial adjustment.
- Customization feasibility is separate from Production request lifecycle.
- Delivery quantity cannot exceed remaining quantity; only one active batch is allowed per Order.

### 0.5 ADMIN

**Flow**

```text
Administer accounts/catalog -> oversee assignments/workload
-> monitor reports/financial exceptions -> use explicitly allowed overrides
-> review/publish/archive showcases
```

| Area | APIs available to ADMIN | Contract detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts/workload | Account search/detail and Designer/Sales/Production workload | [Accounts](#4-accounts), [Admin reports](#appendix-d--admin-reports-scrum-428--scrum-436) |
| Catalog | Business types, categories, products, versions, preview files and layout assets | [Catalog](#5-catalog--business-types) |
| Project workflow | Project/proposal/planner/quotation/order/area/schedule/file/chat actions explicitly listing `ADMIN` | [Projects](#9-projects) onward |
| Finance | Summary, receivables, statements, breakdown/trend/projects/payments/exceptions/discounts | [Admin finance](#20a-admin-financial-dashboard) |
| Reports | Project workflow/attention, business/commercial/production/delivery/catalog reports and CSV export | [Project attention](#appendix-c--admin-project-attention-reports), [Admin reports](#appendix-d--admin-reports-scrum-428--scrum-436) |
| Dashboards | Sales/Designer/Production queues and phase risks where listed | [Role dashboards](#20c-role-dashboards-queues--kpis) |
| Payments/showcases | PayOS confirmation/test helper; showcase moderation | [Payments](#204-webhooks--admin--test), [Showcases](#23-portfolio--public-showcases) |

**Cases to handle**

- `ADMIN` is broad, not a universal bypass. Customer-only actions remain unavailable unless explicitly listed.
- CSV report success is raw `text/csv`; failures still use the JSON envelope.
- Financial dashboard APIs are read-only unless a separate mutation is documented.
- `/api/test/payments` must not be exposed in production clients.

### 0.6 Public / no-role / auth gaps

“No role” is split into intentional public access and accidental unprotected access. Clients must not treat an authorization gap as a stable public contract.

#### Anonymous/public APIs

Two source patterns intentionally serve unauthenticated clients:

- **Explicit `[AllowAnonymous]`:** public showcase controller, provider webhooks, selected Auth actions, and `GET /files/by-reference`.
- **No authorization attribute, intended catalog read:** the read-only catalog routes listed below. These are unauthenticated in the current controller source but do not carry `[AllowAnonymous]`; preserve that distinction when a global fallback authorization policy is introduced.

| Area | APIs | Request / response / flow / important cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth | Register, verify/resend OTP, login, refresh, forgot/reset password | Explicit `[AllowAnonymous]`; JSON DTOs; success sets HttpOnly cookies; 10/min/IP; resend/forgot are enumeration-safe. See [Auth](#3-auth--auth). |
| Business types | `GET /business-types`, `GET /business-types/{businessTypeId}` | No auth attribute; filtered/paged list or integer-ID detail. |
| Categories | `GET /categories` | No auth attribute; paged catalog list. |
| Products | Suggest/search/list/detail/similar/by-category and preview reads | No auth attribute; filters differ by action; see [Products](#7-catalog--products). |
| Product versions | Public version detail as currently coded | No auth attribute; see [Product versions](#8-catalog--product-versions). |
| Public showcases | Published list and slug detail | Explicit controller-level `[AllowAnonymous]`; search/business type/sort/paging; curated public media only. |
| Shared files | `GET /files/by-reference` | Explicit action-level `[AllowAnonymous]`, but service still applies reference/visibility rules. |
| Provider webhooks | PayOS and SePay webhook POSTs | Explicit `[AllowAnonymous]`; provider-to-server only; signature/timestamp validation; not a client API. |
| Infrastructure | Root, Swagger/OpenAPI and optional Redis health | Operational/debug endpoints; see Appendix A. |

#### Known authorization gap — do not rely on it

These `AccountsController` CRUD actions currently have no `[Authorize]` or role attribute:

- `GET /api/Accounts`
- `GET /api/Accounts/{accountId}`
- `POST /api/Accounts`
- `PUT /api/Accounts/{accountId}`
- `DELETE /api/Accounts/{accountId}`

They are reachable without a role **as currently implemented**, but this is a security gap, not intended public behavior. Treat them as Admin management contracts pending backend hardening.

### 0.7 JWT without a specific role

| Area | APIs | Service-level scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current identity | `/auth/me`, password, logout and `PATCH /accounts/me` | Current account only |
| Project files | Upload/list/search under `/projects/{projectId}/files` | Stakeholder + visibility rules |
| Shared files | Detail/archive/delete under `/files/{fileId}` | Visibility, uploader/project access and lifecycle |
| Notifications | Own list/count/read/read-all | Current receiver only |
| SignalR | Notifications/chat connect and group joins | Valid JWT plus project/chat membership |

---

## 1. Conventions

### 1.1 Base URL & routing

There is **no single global `/api` prefix**. Routes are defined per controller:

| Pattern | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Root kebab-case | `/auth`, `/products`, `/projects`, `/business-types` |
| Explicit `/api/...` | `/api/payments`, `/api/projects/.../payments/...`, `/api/webhooks/...` |
| Base `[controller]` | `/api/Accounts`, `/api/ProductVersions/...` |

### 1.2 Response envelope

Normal controller success and handled business failures return `ServiceResult` / `ServiceResult<T>` via `BaseApiController.ToActionResult`. HTTP status code equals `status`.

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Success",
  "data": {},
  "errors": null,
  "errorCode": null
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `int` | Same as HTTP status (`200`, `201`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `413`, `415`, `429`, `500`) |
| `message` | `string?` | Human-readable summary |
| `data` | `T?` / `object?` | Payload; may be `null` on pure success messages |
| `errors` | `string[]?` | Omitted when null; validation / field errors |
| `errorCode` | `string?` | Omitted when null; machine-readable code (e.g. `INVALID_BUSINESS_TYPE_FILTER`) |

**Paged lists** often nest pagination inside `data`:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Success",
  "data": {
    "items": [],
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

Some modules use `pageSize` / `totalItems` / `totalPages` / `hasPreviousPage` / `hasNextPage` (`PagedResult<T>`). Field names follow the DTO for that endpoint.

**Envelope exceptions**

- Unhandled exceptions are converted by `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` to RFC-style `ProblemDetails` with HTTP `500` and a `correlationId`; they do not use `ServiceResult`.
- PayOS/SePay webhook actions return provider-specific acknowledgement bodies.
- Admin report export returns raw `text/csv` on success; its handled errors still use `ServiceResult`.

### 1.3 JSON conventions

| Topic | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Property names | **camelCase** (ASP.NET default), except auth expiry fields which use **snake_case** (`token_type`, `expires_in`, `access_token_expires_at`) |
| Enums | String values in **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** (`JsonStringEnumConverter`, no naming policy) |
| Dates | ISO-8601 (`DateTime` / `DateTimeOffset`); `DateOnly` as `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| IDs | UUID (`guid`) unless noted (`businessTypeId` is `int`) |
| Content-Type | `application/json` unless multipart upload |

### 1.4 Roles

| Role | Typical access |
| --- | --- |
| `CUSTOMER` | Own projects, proposals, quotations, orders, payments, chat |
| `SALES` | Project intake, quotations, orders, assignments, schedules |
| `DESIGNER` | Proposals, scenes, room planner, limited project status |
| `PRODUCTION` | Production requests/items, delivery ops, customization queue |
| `ADMIN` | Admin/reporting/catalog routes plus business actions that explicitly list `ADMIN`; no universal bypass |

Authorization: `[Authorize]` / `[Authorize(Roles = "...")]`. Multiple roles in one attribute are OR.

### 1.5 Standard contract for every API

Read each API contract in this order. If an item is not repeated under an endpoint, the common rule in this section applies.

| Contract part | Required documentation | Client implementation rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access | Public, JWT, or exact roles; ownership/assignment scope | Handle `401` separately from `403` |
| Request | Path, query, headers, body/multipart and required fields | Do not send server-owned/calculated fields |
| Validation | Type/range/length/state/cross-field rules | Show field errors from `errors`; do not duplicate business rules as client truth |
| Filters | Supported filters, sort, paging and defaults | Unknown/invalid filters may return `400`; paging names vary by DTO |
| Enum | Exact SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE values | Send strings exactly as documented |
| Response | HTTP status, envelope and `data` DTO | Use HTTP/envelope `status`, not message text, for control flow |
| Flow | State transition and side effects | Refresh affected project/order/payment resources after mutations |
| Cases | Success, idempotent replay, invalid state, missing resource, forbidden scope, conflict | Treat retryability per status/code |
| Error code | Stable machine-readable `errorCode` when service provides one | Branch on `errorCode`, never localized/human message |
| Message | Human-readable context | Display/log safely; do not use as a programmatic key |

**Source precedence:** controller route/auth → request DTO/model binding → Application service validation/flow → Domain enum/state → Infrastructure persistence/provider behavior → this document.

**Common response/status behavior**

| HTTP | Typical message/category | Meaning / client action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | Success / endpoint-specific success message | Read `data`; mutation may also have side effects |
| `201` | Created | Resource was created; read returned ID |
| `400` | Validation failed / invalid request or state | Fix request; inspect `errors` and `errorCode` |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Refresh/login; do not retry unchanged credentials indefinitely |
| `403` | Forbidden | Role, ownership, assignment or visibility failed |
| `404` | Not found | Resource absent or intentionally hidden by access policy |
| `409` | Conflict | State transition, duplicate or concurrent business conflict |
| `413` | Payload too large | Reduce file/request size |
| `415` | Unsupported media type | Correct `Content-Type` or file type |
| `429` | Too many requests | Respect rate limit/backoff |
| `500` | Internal server error | Log correlation ID and retry only when operation is safe/idempotent |

**Error code vs message**

- `errorCode` is optional because some legacy paths return only `message`.
- `errors` contains model/field validation details and may be absent for business validation.
- Messages shown in endpoint sections are current backend wording, not a localization contract.
- Provider errors must not expose secrets, signatures, raw webhook bodies or credentials.

**Common API cases**

1. Valid request and allowed current state.
2. Model-binding/validation failure before service execution.
3. Authenticated user with wrong role.
4. Correct role but wrong owner/assignee/project stakeholder.
5. Resource not found, archived/deleted, or hidden by visibility.
6. Invalid lifecycle transition or duplicate active resource.
7. Idempotent retry, when explicitly documented.
8. External provider/storage/search/cache failure; PostgreSQL remains source of truth unless the flow says otherwise.

### 1.6 Common error examples

**Validation (400)**

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "data": null,
  "errors": ["Email is required", "Password must be at least 8 characters"]
}
```

**Unauthorized (401)** / **Forbidden (403)** / **Not found (404)** / **Conflict (409)** / **Too many requests (429)** follow the same envelope with `data` usually null.

### 1.7 Auth header / cookies

```http
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

Also accepted: HttpOnly cookies `access_token` and `refresh_token` (Secure, SameSite=None, Path=/).

Public auth routes are rate-limited: policy `auth-public` → **10 requests / minute / IP**.

---

## 2. Authentication

### Token delivery

| Endpoint | Sets cookies? | Tokens in JSON body? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /auth/login` | Yes | **No** (`access_token` / `refresh_token` are `[JsonIgnore]`) |
| `POST /auth/verify-email` | Yes | No |
| `POST /auth/refresh` | Yes | No |
| `POST /auth/logout` | Clears cookies | — |

**Auth success `data` shape** (`AuthResponseDto`):

```json
{
  "access_token_expires_at": "2026-07-27T12:00:00+00:00",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 900
}
```

Clients that cannot use cookies must read tokens from a custom FE bridge or extend the API; the current backend intentionally keeps tokens out of the JSON body and sets HttpOnly cookies.

Refresh may send `refreshToken` in the body **or** rely on the `refresh_token` cookie.

SignalR: for `/hubs/notifications` and `/hubs/project-chat`, `?access_token=` query is also accepted.

---

## 3. Auth — `/auth`

Controller: `AuthController` · route `auth`

| Method | Path | Auth | Rate limit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/auth/register` | Public | Yes | Register customer account + send email OTP |
| POST | `/auth/verify-email` | Public | Yes | Verify OTP → session cookies |
| POST | `/auth/resend-verification-otp` | Public | Yes | Resend OTP (enumeration-safe) |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Public | Yes | Login → session cookies |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | Public | Yes | Rotate tokens |
| POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | Public | Yes | Request reset email (enumeration-safe) |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | Public | Yes | Reset with email token |
| GET | `/auth/me` | JWT | — | Current user profile |
| PATCH | `/auth/me` | JWT | — | Update profile |
| PATCH | `/auth/me/password` | JWT | — | Change password |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | JWT | — | Revoke refresh + blacklist access `jti` |

### Auth validation, messages and cases

| Endpoint | Main validation / case | HTTP / current message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| register | Email/password/full name required; password policy; duplicate email; registration throttling | `400` field errors; `409 Email already exists.`; `429 Too many registration attempts...` |
| verify-email | Email + OTP required; OTP invalid/expired; already verified; attempt throttling | `400`, `409 Email is already verified.`, `429` |
| resend OTP | Email required; request throttling; response remains account-enumeration safe | `400 Email is required.` or neutral success; `429` |
| login | Email/password required; invalid credentials/account state; attempt throttling | `400`, `401`, or `429 Too many login attempts...` |
| refresh | Body `refreshToken` or cookie required; token invalid/revoked/expired | `400 Refresh token is required.` or auth failure |
| forgot password | Email required; response is neutral whether account exists; throttling | `400`, neutral `200`, or `429` |
| reset password | Email/token required; new password policy; token invalid/expired; throttling | `400` or `429` |
| update me | Full name required/max 100; phone max 20; account must exist | `400` or `404 Account not found.` |
| change password | Current password required; new password policy; current password mismatch | `400`; account missing can return `404` |
| logout | Valid JWT required; optional body token falls back to cookie; clears cookies | `200 Logged out successfully` |

Raw tokens are intentionally excluded from JSON `data`; Web/Mobile implementations that cannot use cross-site HttpOnly cookies need a separately approved token-delivery contract. Do not attempt to read HttpOnly cookies from JavaScript.

### `POST /auth/register`

**Request**

```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "password": "Str0ngPass!",
  "fullName": "Nguyen Van A",
  "phone": "+84901234567"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | string | Yes |
| `password` | string | Yes |
| `fullName` | string | Yes |
| `phone` | string? | No |

**Response** `201` — account created; if email send fails, still `201` with delivery status in message/data (resend OTP allowed).

### `POST /auth/verify-email`

**Request**

**Request**

```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "password": "Str0ngPass!"
}
```

**Response** `200` — `AuthResponseDto` + Set-Cookie.

### `POST /auth/refresh`

**Request** (optional body; cookie fallback)

## 8. Catalog — Product Versions

`ProductVersionsController` uses base route → paths under `/api/ProductVersions/...`.  
Preview reorder/delete controller uses `[Route("ProductVersions")]` (no `/api` prefix) — document both as implemented.

| Method | Path | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}` | Public |
| POST | `/api/ProductVersions/products/{productId}/versions` | DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| GET | `/api/ProductVersions/products/{productId}/versions` | ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/api/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}` | ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/api/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}/set-default` | ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/api/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}/activate` | ADMIN |

| PATCH | `/api/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}/archive` | ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/api/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}/restore` | ADMIN |
| POST | `/api/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}/files` | DESIGNER, ADMIN · multipart |
| PATCH | `/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}/preview-files/reorder` | ADMIN |
| DELETE | `/ProductVersions/product-versions/{id}/preview-files/{fileId}` | ADMIN |

### Admin version list — query

| Param | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `ProductStatus?` | ACTIVE / INACTIVE / ARCHIVED |
| `versionType` | `ProductVersionType?` | |
| `isDefault` | bool? | |
| `isPublic` | bool? | |
| `isProjectSpecific` | bool? | |
| `projectId` | guid? | PROJECT_SPECIFIC filter |
| `page` / `pageSize` | int | default 1 / 20; max pageSize 100 |

**List response**: `{ items: ProductVersionManagementDto[], page, pageSize, totalCount }`

`ProductVersionManagementDto` adds `projectId?`, `dimensionUnit?`, `createdAt?`, `updatedAt?` to version fields.

### Create body

```json
{
  "versionCode": "V1",
  "versionName": "Natural Oak",
  "versionType": "STANDARD",
  "material": "Oak",
  "color": "Natural",
  "width": 120,
  "height": 75,
  "depth": 60,
  "estimatedPrice": 4500000,
  "isDefault": true,
  "isPublic": true,
  "isProjectSpecific": false
}
```

### Update body

Same fields except `versionCode` is not updated; `versionName` required-by-type.

### Version lifecycle (ADMIN)

Does **not** change parent Product status. Deactivate/archive on a default version clears `isDefault` in the same transaction (no auto-replacement default). Restore sets ACTIVE with `isDefault: false`. `set-default` requires version status ACTIVE.

**Response** (`ProductVersionLifecycleStatusResponseDto`): `productVersionId`, `productId`, `previousStatus`, `status`, `isDefault?`, `updatedAt?`

### Response — `ProductVersionDto` / detail

Includes: `productVersionId`, `productId`, `versionCode`, `versionName`, `versionType?`, `material?`, `color?`, dimensions, `dimensionUnit?`, `estimatedPrice?`, flags, `status?`, `thumbnail?`, `files[]`. Detail may add `productName?`.

| `has3DModel` | bool? | product or version has `MODEL_3D` file link |
| `createdFrom` / `createdTo` | datetime? | |
| `page` / `pageSize` | int | default 1 / 20; max pageSize 100 |
| `sortBy` | string? | `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `productName`, `productCode` |

**Version summary** (list + detail): `productVersionId`, `versionCode`, `versionName`, `versionType?`, `material?`, `color?`, dimensions, `dimensionUnit?`, `estimatedPrice?`, `isProjectSpecific?` — no tax fields.

**Product detail** adds `description?`, `files[]`, `eligibleVersions[]`. **Version detail** adds `projectId?`, `files[]` (preview / 3D per file visibility rules).

  "businessPurpose": "New cafe opening",
  "furnitureRequirement": "Tables, chairs, bar counter",
  "description": "Industrial style",
  "totalAreaSqm": 120.5,
  "numberOfFloors": 1,
  "budgetMin": 50000000,
  "budgetMax": 120000000,
  "targetCompletionDate": "2026-12-31"
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectName` | string | Required |
| `businessType` | string | Free-text (not catalog FK) |
| `furnitureRequirement` | string | Required on create |
| `projectAddress` / `businessPurpose` / `description` | string? | |
| `totalAreaSqm` | decimal? | |
| `numberOfFloors` | int? | |
| `budgetMin` / `budgetMax` | decimal? | |
| `targetCompletionDate` | date? | `YYYY-MM-DD` |

### Target completion date

`PATCH /projects/{projectId}/target-completion-date`

```json
{ "targetCompletionDate": "2026-12-31" }
```

The field is nullable (send `null` to clear it). It cannot be in the past, cannot precede committed Production/schedule dates, and cannot conflict with an active project-start-fee deadline. Customer access is owner-scoped; Sales access is assignment-scoped; Admin is explicitly allowed. Success returns `projectId`, `targetCompletionDate`, `updatedAt`. Important errors: `INVALID_TARGET_COMPLETION_DATE`, `TARGET_COMPLETION_DATE_NOT_EDITABLE`, `TARGET_DATE_CONFLICTS_WITH_OPERATIONAL_DATES`, `TARGET_DATE_CONFLICTS_WITH_ACTIVE_START_FEE`.

### List query

| Param | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | `ProjectStatus?` |
| `assignedSalesId` | guid? |

### Phase deadlines (internal timelines)

Stored in PostgreSQL table **`project_phase_timelines`** (one row per `projectId + phase`). API route name remains `/phase-deadlines`.

Create or update an internal execution plan for the project.

```json
{
  "proposalDueDate": "2026-09-10",
  "productionDueDate": "2026-09-25"
}
```

**Rules**

- Only assigned Sales or Admin can `PUT`.
- Customer, assigned Sales, assigned Designer, assigned Production staff, and Admin can `GET`.
- `PUT` requires project status `IN_CONSULTATION`.
- `proposalDueDate <= productionDueDate`.
- When project `targetCompletionDate` exists, `productionDueDate <= targetCompletionDate`.
- Backend stores exactly one row per `projectId + phase`; repeated `PUT` updates existing rows and preserves original `createdBy` / `createdAt`.

**Response** (`ProjectPhaseDeadlinePlanDto`)

```json
{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "targetCompletionDate": "2026-09-30",
  "deadlines": [
    {
      "phase": "PROPOSAL",
      "dueDate": "2026-09-10",
      "startedAt": "2026-09-01T08:00:00Z",
      "completedAt": "2026-09-09T15:00:00Z",
      "status": "COMPLETED_ON_TIME",
      "overdueDays": 0
    },
    {
      "phase": "PRODUCTION",
      "dueDate": "2026-09-25",
      "startedAt": null,
      "completedAt": null,
      "status": "PLANNED",
      "overdueDays": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

`GET /projects/{projectId}` also embeds the same `phaseDeadlines[]` array for authorized viewers.

`phase`: `PROPOSAL`, `PRODUCTION` only.

`status` is derived at read time, not persisted:

- `PLANNED`: future phase that is not the first open phase.
- `ON_TRACK`: first open phase whose due date has not passed.
- `OVERDUE`: open phase where today is after `dueDate`.
- `COMPLETED_ON_TIME`: `completedAt.Date <= dueDate`.
- `COMPLETED_LATE`: `completedAt.Date > dueDate`.

**Lifecycle hooks**

- `startedAt` set once when project enters `PROPOSAL_CONSULTING` (PROPOSAL) or production request starts `IN_PRODUCTION` (PRODUCTION).
- Publishing a proposal sets PROPOSAL `completedAt` once.
- Completing a production request sets PRODUCTION `completedAt` once.
- Repeated workflow calls do not reset original timestamps.

Common error codes: `INVALID_PROJECT_STATUS`, `INVALID_PHASE_DEADLINE_RANGE`, `PHASE_DEADLINE_EXCEEDS_TARGET`.

**Production-only deadline update**

`PUT /projects/{projectId}/phase-deadlines/production`

```json
{ "productionDeadline": "2026-09-25" }
```

`productionDeadline` is required (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Response contains `projectId`, `orderId`, `phase: PRODUCTION`, `dueDate`, `startedAt`, `completedAt`, and derived `status`. This action exists for the post-quotation/order workflow where only the Production deadline is being configured; it does not replace the two-phase planning request above.

### Sales assignment

```json
{ "note": "Taking this lead" }
```

**Response** (`ProjectSalesAssignmentDto`): `projectId`, `assignedSalesId?`, `status?`, `salesAssignedAt?`, `salesChat?`

### Information request

```json
{ "message": "Please upload floor plan photos" }
```

### Status update

```json
{
  "status": "IN_CONSULTATION",
  "note": "Customer called"
}
```

Customers cannot use this endpoint. Designer target statuses are restricted (`ProjectStatusTransitionEvaluator`).

### Rejection

```json
{ "rejectionReason": "Out of service area" }
```

### Complete project

`PATCH /projects/{projectId}/complete` has no body. Assigned Sales or Admin may call it only after project status is `DELIVERED` and the related Order satisfies completion/payment readiness. It is idempotent when already `COMPLETED`; success returns the completion snapshot and sets `completedAt`. Typical conflicts include `PROJECT_NOT_DELIVERED` and Order/payment readiness errors.

### Reopen proposal

No request body.

Rolls back a project to `PROPOSAL_CONSULTING` **before deposit is paid** and **before production is created**. Supported source project statuses:

- `PROPOSAL_SELECTED` (active quotation typically `DRAFT`, no order required)
- `QUOTATION_SENT` (active quotation typically `SENT`, no order required)
- `ORDER_CONFIRMED` (order `CREATED` or `DEPOSIT_PENDING`, quotation `ACCEPTED`)

In one transaction the backend:

- Cancels or expires active `DEPOSIT` payments when an order exists
- Sets an eligible order (`CREATED` or `DEPOSIT_PENDING`) → `CANCELLED` when present
- Sets the active quotation (`DRAFT`, `SENT`, or `ACCEPTED`) → `CANCELLED`
- Demotes the selected proposal → `PUBLISHED` (clears `selectedAt`)
- Restores auto-rejected sibling proposals when applicable
- Moves project → `PROPOSAL_CONSULTING`

**Response** (`ReopenProposalResponseDto`): `projectId`, `oldStatus?`, `newStatus?`, `orderId?`, `orderStatus?`, `quotationId?`, `quotationStatus?`, `selectedProposalId?`, `selectedProposalStatus?`, `restoredProposalCount`, `updatedAt?`

**Common error codes:** `PROJECT_REOPEN_NOT_ALLOWED`, `PROJECT_NO_ACCEPTED_ORDER`, `PROJECT_SELECTED_PROPOSAL_NOT_FOUND`, `PROJECT_ACTIVE_QUOTATION_NOT_FOUND`, `PROJECT_DEPOSIT_ALREADY_PAID`, `PROJECT_PRODUCTION_ALREADY_CREATED`, `ACTIVE_DEPOSIT_CANNOT_BE_CANCELLED`

**Idempotency:** If project is already `PROPOSAL_CONSULTING`, returns `200` with stable state (no duplicate side effects).

**Access:** customer (own project), assigned sales, or admin.

### Designer assignment

```json
{
  "designerId": "...",
  "spaceDataStatus": "SUFFICIENT",
  "note": "Ready for design"
}
```

`spaceDataStatus`: `SUFFICIENT` | `INSUFFICIENT`

### Chat message search

**Query:** `q`, `page`, `limit`

### Customer project review

`POST /projects/{projectId}/review` body:

```json
{
  "rating": 5,
  "designQualityRating": 5,
  "serviceQualityRating": 4,
  "deliveryRating": 5,
  "comment": "Delivered as agreed."
}
```

All four ratings are required integers from 1 through 5. Only the owning Customer may read/create the review, the project must be `COMPLETED`, and only one review is allowed. New reviews default `allowPublicDisplay=false`; public consent is a separate endpoint in §23. Errors: `PROJECT_REVIEW_NOT_FOUND`, `PROJECT_REVIEW_ALREADY_EXISTS`, `PROJECT_NOT_COMPLETED`, `PROJECT_REVIEW_FORBIDDEN`, `PROJECT_REVIEW_RATING_INVALID`.

### Admin workflow snapshot

`GET /admin/projects/{projectId}/workflow` is ADMIN-only and read-only. It returns project identity/current status/stage, terminal rejection flag, owners, and ordered `stages[]`; each stage contains `key`, `label`, `state`, `statusInStage`, summary/blocker count, metrics, links, and facts. Empty GUID is rejected; an unknown project returns `404`; success message is `Project workflow retrieved successfully.`

### Response — `ProjectDto`

```json
{
  "projectId": "...",
  "customerId": "...",
  "assignedSalesId": null,
  "assignedDesignerId": null,
  "projectCode": "PRJ-2026-0001",
  "projectName": "Cafe District 1",
  "businessType": "Cafe",
  "projectAddress": "...",
  "businessPurpose": "...",
  "furnitureRequirement": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "totalAreaSqm": 120.5,
  "numberOfFloors": 1,
  "budgetMin": 50000000,
  "budgetMax": 120000000,
  "targetCompletionDate": "2026-12-31",
  "status": "SUBMITTED",
  "submittedAt": "2026-07-27T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Project status lifecycle (summary)

```text
SUBMITTED
  → IN_CONSULTATION / NEED_BASIC_INFORMATION
  → WAITING_FOR_DESIGNER_ASSIGNMENT
  → MEASUREMENT_REQUIRED / SPACE_VERIFIED
  → PROPOSAL_CONSULTING → PROPOSAL_SELECTED

## 10. Proposals & scenes

Controller uses `[Route("")]` — absolute paths.

### Proposals

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/projects/{projectId}/proposals` | DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| GET | `/projects/{projectId}/proposals` | CUSTOMER, DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| GET | `/proposals/{proposalId}` | same |
| PATCH | `/proposals/{proposalId}` | DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/proposals/{proposalId}/publish` | DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| POST | `/proposals/{proposalId}/reopen-for-editing` | DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/proposals/{proposalId}/select-final` | CUSTOMER |
| PATCH | `/proposals/{proposalId}/request-revision` | CUSTOMER |

### Scenes

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/proposals/{proposalId}/scenes` | DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| GET | `/proposals/{proposalId}/scenes` | CUSTOMER, DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| GET | `/proposal-scenes/{sceneId}` | same |
| PATCH | `/proposal-scenes/{sceneId}` | DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |

### Items

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/proposals/{proposalId}/items/sync-from-scene` | DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| GET | `/proposals/{proposalId}/items` | CUSTOMER, DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/proposal-items/{proposalItemId}` | DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |
| DELETE | `/proposal-items/{proposalItemId}` | DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN |

### Create proposal

```json
{
  "proposalName": "Concept A — Industrial",
  "description": "Dark oak + black metal"
}
```

### Update proposal

```json
{
  "proposalName": "Concept A",
  "description": "..."
}
```

### Publish / select-final / request-revision

```json
{ "note": "Ready for customer review" }
```

```json
{ "note": "Love this layout" }
```

```json
{ "revisionNote": "Need warmer lighting" }
```

**Select-final response** (`SelectFinalProposalResponseDto`): `proposalId`, `projectId`, `quotationId?`, `proposalStatus?`, `projectStatus?`, `selectedAt?`

On first successful select-final, the backend **auto-creates a draft quotation** from the selected proposal in the same transaction and returns its `quotationId`. Idempotent re-call when the proposal is already `SELECTED` returns `200` without creating another quotation (`quotationId` may be omitted).

Sales normally continue from this draft (`PATCH` quotation → `PATCH` send). `POST /projects/{projectId}/quotations` remains as a manual fallback for SALES/ADMIN.

### Reopen a published proposal for editing

`POST /proposals/{proposalId}/reopen-for-editing` has no body. It changes a `PUBLISHED` proposal back to `DRAFT`, clears `publishedAt`, and returns `proposalId`, `projectId`, `proposalStatus`, `projectStatus`, `updatedAt`. The project must still be `PROPOSAL_CONSULTING`; selected proposals and proposals that already have a quotation cannot be reopened. Assignment/resource scope still applies to Designer/Sales; Admin is explicitly allowed.

Errors: `PROPOSAL_REOPEN_NOT_ALLOWED`, `PROPOSAL_HAS_QUOTATION` (`409`), `PROPOSAL_ALREADY_SELECTED`, proposal not found, or `403`.

### Create scene

```json
{
  "sceneName": "Ground floor",
  "sceneType": "THREE_D",
  "projectAreaId": null,
  "mongoSceneId": null,
  "previewFileId": null
}
```

`sceneType`: `TWO_D` | `THREE_D`

### Update scene

```json
{
  "sceneName": "Ground floor",
  "projectAreaId": null,
  "previewFileId": null,
  "isActive": true
}
```

### Sync items from scene

```json
{
  "sceneId": "...",
  "items": [
    {
      "sceneObjectId": "obj-1",
      "productVersionId": "...",
      "quantity": 4,
      "customizationNote": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:** `proposalId`, `sceneId`, `items[]`, `createdCount`, `updatedCount`, `removedCount`

### Update item

```json
{
  "quantity": 6,
  "customizationNote": "Round corners"
}
```

### List queries

| Resource | Query |
| --- | --- |
| proposals | `status?`, `page`, `limit` |
| scenes | `sceneType?`, `isActive?`, `page`, `limit` |
| items | `sceneId?`, `page`, `limit` |

### Response — proposal / detail

`ProposalDto`: `proposalId`, `projectId`, `parentProposalId?`, `proposalName`, `description?`, `versionNo?`, `status?`, `publishedAt?`, `selectedAt?`, `rejectedAt?`, `createdAt?`, `updatedAt?`

`ProposalDetailDto` adds `scenes[]`, `items[]`.

`ProposalStatus`: `DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`, `SELECTED`, `REVISION_REQUESTED`, `REJECTED`, `ARCHIVED`

## 11. Room planner

Route: `proposal-scenes`

| Method | Path | Roles | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/proposal-scenes/{sceneId}/room-planner` | CUSTOMER, DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN | Load Mongo scene payload |
| POST | `/proposal-scenes/{sceneId}/room-planner/resolve-products` | CUSTOMER, DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN | Resolve scene-referenced ProductVersions + files |
| POST | `/proposal-scenes/{sceneId}/room-planner/resolve-layout-assets` | CUSTOMER, DESIGNER, SALES, ADMIN | Resolve scene-referenced layout assets + files |
| PUT | `/proposal-scenes/{sceneId}/room-planner` | DESIGNER, ADMIN | Save scene payload |
| GET | `/room-planner/layout-assets` | DESIGNER, ADMIN | Layout asset catalog — see [§8c](#8c-catalog--layout-assets) |

### Request / response payload (`RoomPlannerScenePayloadDto`, schema v3)

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 3,
  "editorVersion": "ROOM_PLANNER_BABYLON_BUILDING_V1",
  "unit": "meter",
  "blueprintLayout": {
    "id": "blueprint-{sceneId}",
    "unit": "meter",
    "floors": [
      {
        "id": "floor-...",
        "projectAreaId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "elevation": 0,
        "floorHeight": 3,
        "points": [],
        "walls": [],
        "doors": [],
        "windows": [],
        "openings": []
      }
    ]
  },
  "objects": [],
  "layers": [],
  "stylePreset": null,
  "camera": { },
  "lighting": { },
  "validation": { },
  "editorState": { }
}
```

| Top-level field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | int (required `3`) |
| `editorVersion` | string? |
| `unit` | string (must match `blueprintLayout.unit`) |
| `blueprintLayout` | multi-floor blueprint (`floors[]` is source of truth) |
| `objects` | furniture + layout assets — see object families below |
| `layers` | layer visibility/lock |
| `stylePreset` | string? |
| `camera` | mode, position, target, zoom |
| `lighting` | preset, intensities |
| `validation` | status, warnings, errors |
| `editorState` | active tool, selection, grid/snap |

Notes:

- Root legacy `layout` is not required for schema v3 and is cleared on save.
- `pointId` / `wallId` / `openingId` uniqueness is scoped **per floor**, not globally.
- Each floor `projectAreaId` must match SQL `proposal_scene_areas` for the scene.
- GET with no Mongo document returns an empty schema v3 template built from SQL scene areas (does not create Mongo).
- GET when SQL has `mongoSceneId` but Mongo doc is missing returns `ROOM_PLANNER_DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND`.

### Object families (schema v3)

**Commercial furniture** (unchanged):

- `objectType = FURNITURE`
- Requires `productVersionId`; optional `proposalItemId`
- Proposal sync eligibility: `objectType == FURNITURE && productVersionId != null`

**Layout assets** (non-commercial):

- `objectType`: `LAYOUT_ASSET`, `STRUCTURAL_ASSET`, or `DECORATIVE_ASSET`
- Requires `layoutAssetId` + `layoutAssetType`; **must not** include `productVersionId` / `proposalItemId`
- Save validates referenced layout asset exists and is **ACTIVE**

**Surface materials** (wall/floor styles, not in `objects[]`):

- Wall `style.layoutAssetId` / floor `floorStyle.layoutAssetId` optional; when present must reference ACTIVE `WALL_MATERIAL` / `FLOOR_MATERIAL`

**Floor openings** (`blueprintLayout.metadata.building.levels[].floorOpenings[]`):

- Preserved on save; types include `STAIR`, `VOID`, `SERVICE_SHAFT`
- Optional `layoutAssetId` for stair-linked assets

Inactive/archived layout assets referenced on load return warnings (`LAYOUT_ASSET_INACTIVE`) but the scene payload is still returned.

Planner catalog for placing assets: [§8c](#8c-catalog--layout-assets) · `GET /room-planner/layout-assets`

**GET response** also includes: `sceneId`, `mongoSceneId?`, `proposalId?`, `projectId?`, `projectAreaIds[]`, `areas[]`, `lastSavedAt?`

**POST resolve-products** (`ResolveRoomPlannerProductsRequestDto` → `ResolveRoomPlannerProductsResponseDto`):

- Request: `{ "productVersionIds": ["..."] }` — IDs must already appear in the scene `objects[]`.
- Response: `{ "sceneId", "projectId", "items": [{ productVersionId, productId, productName, versionCode, versionName, dimensions, files[] }] }`.
- Customer receives only `CUSTOMER_VISIBLE` files. Does not expose full project catalog.

**POST resolve-layout-assets** (`ResolveRoomPlannerLayoutAssetsRequestDto` → `ResolveRoomPlannerLayoutAssetsResponseDto`):

- Request: `{ "layoutAssetIds": ["..."] }` — IDs must be referenced in the scene (`objects[]`, `blueprintLayout` wall/floor styles, floor openings).
- Response:

```json
{
  "sceneId": "...",
  "projectId": "...",
  "items": [
    {
      "layoutAssetId": "...",
      "assetCode": "WALL-01",
      "assetName": "Brick wall",
      "assetType": "WALL_MATERIAL",
      "status": "ACTIVE",
      "files": [
        {
          "fileId": "...",
          "fileType": "TEXTURE",
          "url": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...",
          "fileName": "wall.jpg",
          "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
          "isPrimary": true
        }
      ],
      "primaryTexture": { "fileId": "...", "url": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/..." },
      "primaryModel": null,
      "primaryPreview": null
    }
  ]
}
```

- **CUSTOMER** may call this on proposals in `PUBLISHED`, `REVISION_REQUESTED`, `SELECTED`, or `REJECTED` status (same visibility as `GET room-planner`).
- Customer receives only `CUSTOMER_VISIBLE` files — set texture/model file visibility accordingly at upload (`POST /layout-assets/{id}/files`, default `CUSTOMER_VISIBLE`).
- File URLs are Firebase Storage download URLs (`PublicUrl` at upload). Browser CORS/403 on texture load is a **Firebase bucket CORS + Storage rules** concern, not the API auth layer; ensure the bucket allows read for those objects and CORS includes the FE origin.

**PUT response** (`RoomPlannerSceneSaveResponseDto`): `sceneId`, `mongoSceneId`, `lastSavedAt`

Nested planner document details in this section are derived from the current DTOs, validators and Mongo repository.

## 12. Quotations

Absolute routes on `QuotationsController`.

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/projects/{projectId}/quotations` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| GET | `/quotations/{quotationId}` | same |
| POST | `/projects/{projectId}/quotations` | SALES, ADMIN · no body · **fallback** (normal flow: auto-created on select-final) |
| PATCH | `/quotations/{quotationId}` | SALES, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/quotations/{quotationId}/items/{quotationItemId}/financials` | SALES, ADMIN |
| PUT | `/quotations/{quotationId}/items/financials` | SALES, ADMIN · bulk item financials |
| PATCH | `/quotations/{quotationId}/send` | SALES, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/quotations/{quotationId}/revise` | SALES, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/quotations/{quotationId}/cancel` | SALES, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/quotations/{quotationId}/accept` | CUSTOMER |
| PATCH | `/quotations/{quotationId}/request-revision` | CUSTOMER |
| PATCH | `/quotations/{quotationId}/reject` | CUSTOMER |

Accepting a quotation creates an **Order** in status **`CREATED`**. The order snapshots `depositAmount`, `vatRate`, `vatAmount`, and monetary totals from the accepted quotation header. Deposit is **not** collected at accept time — the customer initiates deposit payment separately (§13).

Draft quotations are initialized with `depositAmount = 30%` of `totalAmount` (config: `OrderWorkflow:DepositPercent`). Sales may edit `depositAmount` on the quotation while it is still `DRAFT` / `REVISED`; send and accept require `0 < depositAmount ≤ totalAmount`. After item financials change, update `depositAmount` if the default no longer fits the new total.

### List query

`status?` (`QuotationStatus`)

### Update quotation

Only non-calculated header fields are writable. The backend recalculates `subtotalAmount`, `totalDiscountAmount`, `preVatAmount`, `vatAmount`, and `totalAmount` from quotation items whenever item financials change.

Draft quotations are created with header `vatRate = 0.08` (8%). VAT is applied once at the quotation header, not per item.

```json
{
  "validUntil": "2026-08-31",
  "depositAmount": 5832000,
  "customerNote": null,
  "salesNote": "VIP discount",
  "revisionReason": null
}
```

Writable: `validUntil`, `depositAmount`, `customerNote`, `salesNote`, `revisionReason`. Monetary header totals remain server-calculated from items.

### Update item financials

Single item (`PATCH .../items/{quotationItemId}/financials`) or bulk (`PUT .../items/financials`). Writable fields: `quantity`, `unitPrice`, `discountAmount`. All monetary totals on items and header are server-calculated.

```json
{
  "quantity": 4,
  "unitPrice": 4500000,
  "discountAmount": 0
}
```

Bulk body:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "quotationItemId": "...",
      "quantity": 4,
      "unitPrice": 4500000,
      "discountAmount": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Customer revision / reject

```json
{ "revisionReason": "Price too high on chairs" }
```

```json
{ "rejectReason": "Changed requirements" }
```

### Response — `QuotationDetailDto`

```json
{
  "quotationId": "...",
  "projectId": "...",
  "proposalId": "...",
  "quotationCode": "QT-...",
  "versionNo": 1,
  "subtotalAmount": 18000000,

      "proposalItemId": "...",
      "productVersionId": "...",
      "productNameSnapshot": "Oak Cafe Table",
      "productVersionNameSnapshot": "Natural Oak",
      "productVersionCodeSnapshot": "TABLE-OAK-001-A",
      "quantity": 4,
      "unitPrice": 4500000,
      "grossAmount": 18000000,
      "discountAmount": 0,
      "totalAmount": 18000000,
      "isCustomized": false,
      "customizationNote": null,
      "note": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Quotation item formula (all amounts **pre-VAT**):

- `grossAmount = quantity * unitPrice`
- `totalAmount = grossAmount - discountAmount`

Quotation header formula:

- `subtotalAmount = SUM(item.grossAmount)`
- `totalDiscountAmount = SUM(item.discountAmount)`
- `preVatAmount = SUM(item.totalAmount)`
- `vatAmount = ROUND(preVatAmount * vatRate)` — `vatRate` is a decimal fraction (`0.08` = 8%)
- `totalAmount = preVatAmount + vatAmount`

`QuotationStatus`: `DRAFT`, `SENT`, `REVISION_REQUESTED`, `REVISED`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, `EXPIRED`, `CANCELLED`

## 13. Orders

Absolute routes on `OrdersController`.

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/projects/{projectId}/orders` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/orders/{orderId}` | same |
| GET | `/orders/me` | CUSTOMER · paginated own Orders |
| PATCH | `/orders/{orderId}/delivery-details` | CUSTOMER, ADMIN |

| GET | `/projects/{projectId}/product-issues` | CUSTOMER, SALES, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/product-issues/{issueId}` | same |

> Source correction: current controllers restrict batch creation/completion to `PRODUCTION,ADMIN`. The three obsolete delivery/final-payment shortcuts are `ADMIN` only. New clients must use confirmed schedules plus delivery batches.

**Delivery flow (current multi-batch flow + obsolete Admin shortcuts):**

1. Related production request must be **`COMPLETED`** before any delivery action; otherwise `409 PRODUCTION_NOT_COMPLETED`.
2. A confirmed delivery schedule is required by the current batch flow. `POST /orders/{orderId}/deliveries` validates readiness and creates an `IN_PROGRESS` batch.
3. `PATCH .../complete` increments `order_items.delivered_quantity`, may set item status `PARTIALLY_DELIVERED` or `DELIVERED`, and marks the batch `COMPLETED`.
4. Multiple active delivery schedules per project are allowed (multi-round delivery).
5. `start-delivery`, `complete-delivery` and `prepare-final-payment` remain Admin-only obsolete compatibility actions. Do not build new FE/Mobile flows on them.
6. Customer `confirm-delivery` when **all** deliverable quantities are delivered — sets `customerConfirmedDeliveryAt`, project `DELIVERED`, triggers remaining payment flow.

Quantity rules:

- Batch item `quantity` must be `> 0` and `<= remaining deliverable quantity` for that order item.
- Transaction-safe updates; duplicate complete on same batch is idempotent where applicable.

`OrderItemStatus` adds `PARTIALLY_DELIVERED` for items with some but not all units delivered.

At most **one active** delivery batch per order in `IN_PROGRESS` at a time (complete before creating another).

**Target completion date:** operational schedule and production dates must be `<= project.targetCompletionDate`. Shortening target below existing schedule/production dates returns `409 TARGET_DATE_CONFLICTS_WITH_OPERATIONAL_DATES`.

`PaidAmount` / `RemainingAmount` live on **Order**, not on Payment.

New orders start as **`CREATED`** after quotation accept. Deposit payment is initiated explicitly; creating a deposit payment from `CREATED` moves the order to **`DEPOSIT_PENDING`**. Webhook/settlement then moves to `DEPOSIT_PAID`.

### Update delivery details

`PATCH /orders/{orderId}/delivery-details`

Roles: **CUSTOMER** (own order only), **ADMIN** override.

```json
{
  "deliveryAddress": "123 Nguyen Trai, District 1",
  "receiverName": "Nguyen Van A",
  "receiverPhone": "0901234567",
  "deliveryNote": "Call before arrival"
}
```

Required fields: `deliveryAddress`, `receiverName`, `receiverPhone`. Whitespace-only values are invalid. `deliveryNote` is optional and may be `null`/omitted.

Editable while deposit is not paid. `CREATED` and `DEPOSIT_PENDING` remain editable, including when a pending payment exists. Once deposit is paid (`DEPOSIT_PAID` or later production/delivery lifecycle status), the endpoint returns `400 ORDER_DELIVERY_DETAILS_LOCKED`.

Success response data:

```json
{
  "orderId": "uuid",
  "deliveryAddress": "123 Nguyen Trai, District 1",
  "receiverName": "Nguyen Van A",
  "receiverPhone": "0901234567",
  "deliveryNote": "Call before arrival"
}
```

Errors: `ORDER_NOT_FOUND`, `ORDER_DELIVERY_DETAILS_INVALID`, `ORDER_DELIVERY_DETAILS_LOCKED`, `403` when a customer tries to update another customer's order.

### Create deposit / remaining payment

```json
{
  "expiredAt": "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "note": "Deposit invoice"
}
```

Eligible order statuses: **`CREATED`** (creates payment and moves order → `DEPOSIT_PENDING`) or **`DEPOSIT_PENDING`** (reuses an active pending deposit payment when present). Amount is always taken from the order snapshot `depositAmount`.

Deposit payment requires complete delivery details before both reusable-payment and new-payment branches:

- `deliveryAddress` required
- `receiverName` required
- `receiverPhone` required
- `deliveryNote` optional

If any required field is missing/blank, response is `400 ORDER_DELIVERY_DETAILS_REQUIRED` with message `Delivery details must be completed before deposit payment.` Existing active pending deposit payment does not bypass this validation.

### Create production request

```json
{
  "assignedTo": "...",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "note": null
}
```

`assignedTo` is required and must reference an active Production account.
`priority` is a string; when omitted, the backend defaults it to `NORMAL`.
Production deadline is not sent in this request. The backend reads it from `project_phase_timelines` where `phase = PRODUCTION`; configure it via `PUT /projects/{projectId}/phase-deadlines` before creating a production request.

### Create delivery batch

```json
{
  "note": "Round 1 — tables only",
  "items": [
    { "orderItemId": "uuid", "quantity": 2, "note": null },
    { "orderItemId": "uuid", "quantity": 4 }
  ]
}
```

Returns `DeliveryDetailDto` (`201`) with batch `deliveryId`, `status: IN_PROGRESS`, and line items.

### Complete delivery batch

No body. Marks batch `COMPLETED`, updates item delivered quantities/statuses. Response: `DeliveryBatchCompletionDto` with `updatedItemCount`.

### List / detail deliveries

`DeliveryListResponseDto.items[]`: `deliveryId`, `orderId`, `status`, `itemCount`, `createdAt`, `completedAt?`

`DeliveryDetailDto` adds `items[]` with per-line `quantity`, `productNameSnapshot`, `note`.

### Order payment history

`GET /orders/{orderId}/payments`

- **Roles:** CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN; project/order scope still applies.
- **Filters:** `status?` (`PaymentStatus`), `paymentType?` (`PaymentType`).
- **Response:** Order totals (`totalAmount`, `depositAmount`, `paidAmount`, `remainingAmount`) plus `payments[]`; each payment embeds transaction attempts with provider/method/status/time/failure reason.
- **Flow/detail:** Read-only reconciliation endpoint. Do not derive Order paid/remaining totals by summing client-visible transactions; use returned Order totals.

### Delivery tracking

`GET /orders/{orderId}/delivery-tracking`

- **Roles:** CUSTOMER, SALES, PRODUCTION, ADMIN.
- **Request:** `orderId` path only; no body/filter.
- **Response:** Ordered/delivered/remaining quantities, progress percent, completed/in-progress/upcoming counts, next delivery time and batch timeline.
- **Flow/detail:** Read-only projection over Order items, delivery batches and delivery schedules. Useful for Web/Mobile tracking without N+1 schedule calls.

### Complete delivery (legacy shortcut)

No request body. Admin-only obsolete compatibility path; creates and completes one batch with all remaining deliverable quantities. New clients must not use it.

### Confirm delivery (customer)

No request body. Requires all deliverable items fully delivered (`DELIVERED` or full quantity) and order `DELIVERING`.

After `confirm-delivery`:

- If `remainingAmount > 0`, backend creates or reuses an active `REMAINING_PAYMENT`, sets order status to `FINAL_PAYMENT_PENDING`, and notifies the customer.
- If `remainingAmount = 0`, order moves to `COMPLETED` without a zero-value payment.
- `PATCH /orders/{orderId}/prepare-final-payment` remains a Sales/Admin fallback.

### Response — order detail

```json
{
  "orderId": "...",
  "projectId": "...",
  "proposalId": "...",
  "quotationId": "...",
  "orderCode": "ORD-...",
  "customerId": "...",
  "salesId": "...",
  "vatRate": 0.08,
  "vatAmount": 1440000,
  "originalTotalAmount": 19440000,
  "itemAdjustmentAmount": 0,
  "additionalDiscountAmount": 0,
  "finalTotalAmount": 19440000,
  "depositAmount": 5832000,
  "paidAmount": 0,
  "remainingAmount": 19440000,
  "status": "CREATED",
  "items": [
    {
      "orderItemId": "...",
      "productNameSnapshot": "Oak Cafe Table",
      "quantity": 4,
      "deliveredQuantity": 0,
      "unitPrice": 4500000,
      "discountAmount": 0,
      "subtotalAmount": 18000000,
      "status": "PENDING"
    }
  ]
}
```

Order header `vatRate` and `vatAmount` are snapshotted from the accepted quotation at order creation and are not recalculated when quotation header values change later.

Order item formula:

- `subtotalAmount = quantity * unitPrice - discountAmount` (pre-VAT; copied from quotation item `totalAmount` at accept time)

`OrderStatus`: `CREATED`, `DEPOSIT_PENDING`, `DEPOSIT_PAID`, `IN_PRODUCTION`, `READY_FOR_DELIVERY`, `DELIVERING`, `DELIVERED`, `FINAL_PAYMENT_PENDING`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`

`OrderItemStatus`: `PENDING`, `IN_PRODUCTION`, `READY`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `PARTIALLY_DELIVERED`, `DELIVERED`, `CANCELLED`

### Order error codes and validation cases

| Error code | Case |
| --- | --- |
| `ORDER_NOT_FOUND`, `ORDER_ITEM_NOT_FOUND`, `DELIVERY_NOT_FOUND` | Path/line resource does not exist or is not visible |
| `INVALID_ORDER_STATUS`, `ORDER_NOT_DELIVERING`, `ORDER_NOT_AWAITING_CUSTOMER_CONFIRMATION` | Current lifecycle state does not allow action |
| `ORDER_DELIVERY_DETAILS_INVALID`, `ORDER_DELIVERY_DETAILS_REQUIRED`, `ORDER_DELIVERY_DETAILS_LOCKED` | Missing/blank delivery fields, deposit precondition, or post-deposit lock |
| `DEPOSIT_ALREADY_PAID`, `REMAINING_PAYMENT_ALREADY_PAID`, `ORDER_PAYMENT_ALREADY_STARTED` | Duplicate or conflicting payment flow |
| `PRODUCTION_NOT_COMPLETED`, `DELIVERABLE_ITEMS_NOT_READY`, `DELIVERABLE_ITEMS_NOT_DELIVERED` | Production/delivery readiness failed |
| `PROJECT_SCHEDULE_ID_REQUIRED`, `DELIVERY_SCHEDULE_INVALID`, `DELIVERY_SCHEDULE_NOT_CONFIRMED`, `DELIVERY_SCHEDULE_ALREADY_USED`, `DELIVERY_SCHEDULE_NOT_STARTED` | Delivery schedule precondition failed |
| `DELIVERY_BATCH_EMPTY`, `DUPLICATE_ORDER_ITEM_IN_BATCH`, `INVALID_DELIVERY_QUANTITY`, `DELIVERY_BATCH_IN_PROGRESS` | Invalid delivery batch body or concurrency rule |
| `ORDER_ITEM_NOT_DELIVERABLE`, `NO_REMAINING_DELIVERY_QUANTITY` | Item cancelled/unavailable/already fully delivered |
| `REMAINING_PAYMENT_NOT_REQUIRED`, `REMAINING_PAYMENT_NOT_PAID`, `ORDER_NOT_READY_TO_COMPLETE` | Final settlement/completion condition failed |
| `ORDER_LIST_PAGINATION_INVALID` | `/orders/me` page/pageSize invalid |

Business validation generally returns `400` or `409` depending on whether the request is malformed or conflicts with current state. Authorization/ownership returns `401/403`; clients must branch on HTTP status and `errorCode`, not message text.

### Product issue reports (record-only)

Customer may report an issue when `orderItem.deliveredQuantity > 0`. Does not block delivery confirmation, remaining payment, or project completion.

`POST /orders/{orderId}/product-issues` — `multipart/form-data`

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orderItemId` | yes | Must belong to order |
| `deliveryItemId` | no | Trace batch; must match order item |
| `issueType` | yes | See `DeliveryProductIssueType` |
| `description` | yes | Human-readable explanation |
| `affectedQuantity` | no | `> 0` and `<= deliveredQuantity` when supplied |
| `files[]` | no | Evidence; `FileType=PRODUCT_ISSUE_EVIDENCE`, `ReferenceType=DELIVERY_PRODUCT_ISSUE_REPORT` |

`GET /projects/{projectId}/product-issues` — same read roles as order list.

`DeliveryProductIssueType`: `DAMAGED`, `WRONG_ITEM`, `WRONG_SPECIFICATION`, `MISSING_PART`, `QUALITY_DEFECT`, `INSTALLATION_ISSUE`, `QUANTITY_MISMATCH`, `OTHER`

---

## 13a. Operational delay reports

Record-only internal evidence. No resolve/update workflow. `CUSTOMER` and `DESIGNER` cannot access.

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/projects/{projectId}/delay-reports/production` | SALES, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| POST | `/projects/{projectId}/delay-reports/delivery` | SALES, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/projects/{projectId}/delay-reports?phase=PRODUCTION\|DELIVERY` | same |
| GET | `/delay-reports/{reportId}` | same |

Production deadline source: `ProjectPhaseTimeline(PRODUCTION).dueDate` (snapshotted at create).  
Delivery deadline source: `Project.targetCompletionDate` (not delivery schedule `scheduledEnd`).

Create production report:

```json
{
  "productionRequestId": "uuid",
  "productionReasonCode": "MATERIAL_DELAY",
  "reasonDetail": "Material shipment delayed."
}
```

Create delivery report:

```json
{
  "orderId": "uuid",
  "deliveryId": "uuid",
  "deliveryReasonCode": "SITE_NOT_READY",
  "reasonDetail": "Customer site is not ready."
}
```

Backend derives `deadlineSnapshot`, `delayState` (`AT_RISK` on/before deadline, `OVERDUE` after), `reportedBy`, `reportedAt`. Client must not send these fields.

`OperationalDelayPhase`: `PRODUCTION`, `DELIVERY`  
`OperationalDelayState`: `AT_RISK`, `OVERDUE`  
`ProductionDelayReasonCode`: `MATERIAL_DELAY`, `TECHNICAL_ISSUE`, `CUSTOMIZATION_ISSUE`, `CAPACITY_CONSTRAINT`, `QUALITY_REWORK`, `DEPENDENCY_DELAY`, `OTHER`  
`DeliveryDelayReasonCode`: `CUSTOMER_RESCHEDULE`, `VEHICLE_ISSUE`, `PRODUCT_NOT_READY`, `SITE_NOT_READY`, `STAFF_UNAVAILABLE`, `WEATHER`, `ACCESS_RESTRICTION`, `OTHER`

---

## 14. Customization requests

Multi-version model: one **request** snapshots a source product version; the designer creates multiple **versions** (each with its own PROJECT_SPECIFIC product version).

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/projects/{projectId}/customization-requests` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/customization-requests/{id}` | same |
| GET | `/customization-requests/{id}/versions` | same |
| GET | `/customization-requests/{id}/versions/{versionId}` | same |
| POST | `/proposal-items/{proposalItemId}/customization-requests` | CUSTOMER, DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| POST | `/customization-requests/{id}/versions` | DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/customization-requests/{id}/versions/{versionId}` | DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| POST | `/customization-requests/{id}/versions/{versionId}/submit-for-review` | DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| POST | `/customization-requests/{id}/versions/{versionId}/withdraw` | DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| POST | `/customization-requests/{id}/accept` | CUSTOMER |
| PATCH | `/customization-requests/{id}/cancel` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| GET | `/api/production/customization-versions` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN · global queue |
| GET | `/api/production/customization-versions/{versionId}` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/api/production/customization-versions/{versionId}/review` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN |

### Project list query

`proposalId?`, `sourceProductVersionId?`, `status?`

### Production queue query

`status?`, `feasibilityStatus?`, `projectId?`, `proposalId?`, `materialAvailable?`, `fromDate?`, `toDate?`, `page`, `pageSize`

Default for PRODUCTION (no filters): `status=REVIEWING`, `feasibilityStatus=PENDING`.

### Submit customization request

```json
{
  "requestTitle": "Shorter table legs",
  "requestDescription": "Reduce height by 5cm",
  "requestedWidth": null,
  "requestedHeight": 70,
  "requestedDepth": null,
  "requestedMaterial": "Oak",
  "requestedColor": "Walnut",
  "requestedChangeNote": "Match bar stool height"
}
```

### Create version (Product Version + version row + file links in one transaction)

Upload files to the project first, then reference file IDs in the body. `previewFileIds` may be omitted, empty, or null.

```json
{
  "versionTitle": "Walnut option",
  "designerNote": "Reinforced frame",
  "versionName": "Chair Custom V1",
  "versionCode": "CHAIR-CUSTOM-V1",
  "material": "Walnut",
  "color": "Dark Brown",
  "width": 65,
  "height": 85,
  "depth": 60,
  "dimensionUnit": "cm",
  "estimatedPrice": 3200000,
  "modelFileId": "model-file-id",
  "previewFileIds": ["preview-file-id"]
}
```

### Update draft version

Same fields as create (partial update). Replacing `modelFileId` / `previewFileIds` syncs `file_links` in the same transaction.

### Production review (per version)

```json
{
  "result": "FEASIBLE",
  "materialAvailable": true,
  "estimatedProductionDays": 14,
  "estimatedAdditionalCost": 500000,
  "additionalCostReason": "Custom cut",
  "feasibilityNote": "OK",
  "productionRiskNote": null,
  "alternativeMaterialNote": null
}
```

`result`: `FEASIBLE` (version stays `REVIEWING`, feasibility → `FEASIBLE`) or `NOT_FEASIBLE` (version → `PRODUCTION_REJECTED`).

### Customer accept version

```json
{
  "customizationRequestVersionId": "version-id"
}
```

Requires request `REVIEWING`, version `REVIEWING` with `feasibilityStatus=FEASIBLE`, and production `estimatedAdditionalCost` set.

On accept, the accepted version's linked `ProductVersion.estimatedPrice` is set to **source version `estimatedPrice` + `estimatedAdditionalCost`** (final catalog price for the project-specific version).

### Cancel request

```json
{ "cancelReason": "No longer needed" }
```

### Version list / detail response (per version)

Includes: `versionNo`, `versionTitle`, `status`, `feasibilityStatus`, production review fields, `isAccepted`, embedded `productVersion` summary (name, code, material, dimensions, price), and `productVersion.files[]` (model/preview metadata per catalog file convention).

**Access:** DRAFT versions are visible to DESIGNER/ADMIN only on project-scoped endpoints. PRODUCTION uses the global queue endpoints (no project assignment required).

### Request status enum

`SUBMITTED`, `REVIEWING`, `ACCEPTED`, `CANCELLED`

### Version status enum

`DRAFT`, `REVIEWING`, `ACCEPTED`, `PRODUCTION_REJECTED`, `WITHDRAWN`

### Production feasibility enum

`PENDING`, `FEASIBLE`, `NOT_FEASIBLE`

## 15. Project areas

| Method | Path(s) | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/project-areas/{projectId}` **and** `/projects/{projectId}/areas` | SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| GET | `/projects/{projectId}/areas` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN · `includeCancelled` |
| GET | `/project-areas/{projectAreaId}` | same |
| PATCH | `/project-areas/{id}` | SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/project-areas/{id}/cancel` | SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| POST | `/project-areas/{projectAreaId}/files` | SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN · multipart |
| GET | `/project-areas/{projectAreaId}/files` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/project-areas/{projectAreaId}/files/{fileId}/primary` | SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| GET | `/project-areas/{projectAreaId}/measurement-images` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN | Area measurement gallery |
| POST | `/project-areas/{projectAreaId}/measurement-images/{fileId}/link` | SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN | Link captured photo to area |
| DELETE | `/project-areas/{projectAreaId}/measurement-images/{fileId}/link` | SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN | Unlink photo from area |

### Create / update body

```json
{
  "parentAreaId": null,
  "areaName": "Ground floor seating",
  "areaType": "ROOM",
  "floorNumber": 1,
  "description": "...",
  "areaSqm": 45,
  "width": 6,
  "length": 7.5,
  "height": 3.2,
  "currentCondition": "Empty shell",
  "requirementNote": "Need banquettes",
  "status": "DRAFT"
}
```

`areaType`: `STORE`, `FLOOR`, `ROOM`, `ZONE`, `OUTDOOR_AREA`, `OTHER`  
`status`: `DRAFT`, `NEED_MEASUREMENT`, `MEASURED`, `VERIFIED`, `CANCELLED`

### Project-area files

Upload uses `multipart/form-data` with the same `file`, `fileType`, `visibility?`, `note?` contract and 100 MiB request limit as project files. List filters are `fileType?`, `visibility?`, `page` (default 1), `limit` (default 20). Customer visibility is service-filtered; merely having the route role does not expose staff/private files. Setting primary has no body and requires the file to be linked to that area.

### Measurement images (area assignment)

Measurement photos are captured on **MEASUREMENT** schedules (§16), then optionally linked to one or more project areas.

**Link flow**

1. Designer uploads image on a confirmed measurement schedule (`POST /project-schedules/{scheduleId}/measurement-images`, multipart).
2. Staff links the same `fileId` to areas via `POST .../link` when area was not included at upload time.
3. Unlink removes only the area `file_links` row; the underlying file and schedule link remain.

**Gallery query** (`GET /project-areas/{projectAreaId}/measurement-images`): `page`, `limit`

**Response item** (`MeasurementImageGalleryItemDto`): `fileId`, `url`, `uploadedAt`, `measurementSchedule` (`scheduleId`, `scheduledStart`), `areas[]` (`projectAreaId`, `areaName`)

**Error codes**: `MEASUREMENT_IMAGE_SCHEDULE_NOT_ELIGIBLE`, `MEASUREMENT_IMAGE_CAPTURE_BEFORE_START`, `MEASUREMENT_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND`, `MEASUREMENT_IMAGE_AREA_LINK_EXISTS`, `MEASUREMENT_IMAGE_AREA_LINK_NOT_FOUND`, `MEASUREMENT_IMAGE_STORAGE_PATH_INVALID`

---

## 16. Project schedules

Route: `project-schedules` (+ absolute create alias)

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/project-schedules/{projectId}` **and** `/projects/{projectId}/schedules` | SALES, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/project-schedules?projectId=` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/project-schedules/my-assigned` | SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/project-schedules/{id}` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/project-schedules/{id}` | SALES, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/project-schedules/{id}/status` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| DELETE | `/project-schedules/{id}` | SALES, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| POST | `/project-schedules/{scheduleId}/request-change` | CUSTOMER, ADMIN | Request delivery schedule change |
| POST | `/project-schedules/{scheduleId}/measurement-images` | DESIGNER, ADMIN | Upload measurement photo (multipart) |
| GET | `/project-schedules/{scheduleId}/measurement-images` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN | Schedule measurement gallery |

### Create

```json
{
  "scheduleType": "MEASUREMENT",
  "title": "Site measurement",
  "description": "...",
  "assignedStaffId": "...",
  "scheduledStart": "2026-08-01T09:00:00Z",
  "scheduledEnd": "2026-08-01T11:00:00Z",
  "location": "123 Nguyen Hue",
  "customerNote": "Call before arrival",
  "internalNote": null
}
```

`scheduleType`: `MEASUREMENT`, `CONSULTATION`, `DESIGN_REVIEW`, `DELIVERY`, `HANDOVER`, `OTHER`

### Create / update time validation

Create and update preserve existing authorization and lifecycle rules.

For `MEASUREMENT` and `DELIVERY` schedules:

- `scheduledStart` and `scheduledEnd` are required.
- `scheduledEnd` must be after `scheduledStart`.
- Backend evaluates the instant in **Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh** business time.
- Start and end must be on the same Vietnam local date.
- Business window is inclusive: local start `>= 06:00`, local end `<= 22:00`.
- Exact `06:00` and `22:00` are valid; `05:59` or `22:01` are invalid.

Errors: `SCHEDULE_TIME_INVALID`, `SCHEDULE_OUTSIDE_BUSINESS_HOURS`.

For same-staff appointment conflicts:

- `MEASUREMENT` and `DELIVERY` schedules require at least **2 hours** between the new appointment and existing `MEASUREMENT`/`DELIVERY` appointments for the same `assignedStaffId`.
- Applies across projects and cross-type pairs: measurement-measurement, measurement-delivery, delivery-delivery.
- `CANCELLED` schedules are ignored.
- For `COMPLETED` schedules, effective busy end is `completedAt`; otherwise it is `scheduledEnd`.
- Exactly 2 hours gap is valid; less than 2 hours is rejected.

Validation formula:

```text
valid if newStart >= existingEffectiveBusyEnd + 2 hours
     OR newEnd + 2 hours <= existingStart
```

Errors: `SCHEDULE_OVERLAP` for actual time intersection, `SCHEDULE_MINIMUM_GAP_NOT_MET` for non-overlapping appointments with less than 2 hours between them.

Other schedule types keep the legacy overlap-only validation.

For `DELIVERY` schedules:

- `location` is required on create.
- `ProjectSchedule.location` is the authoritative actual appointment location.
- Backend does **not** auto-copy `Order.deliveryAddress` into schedule location.
- New delivery schedule starts as `PENDING_CONFIRMATION`.
- Material changes to schedule time/end/location move the schedule back to `PENDING_CONFIRMATION` for customer reconfirmation.

### Update status

```json
{
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "note": "Customer confirmed"
}
```

`status`: `PENDING_CONFIRMATION`, `CONFIRMED`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`

**Complete rules**

- Cannot mark `COMPLETED` before `scheduledStart` → `409 SCHEDULE_COMPLETE_BEFORE_START`.
- On `COMPLETED`, backend sets `completedAt` to current UTC time (once).
- MEASUREMENT schedules may require at least one linked measurement file before complete (config: `RequireMeasurementFileOnScheduleComplete`).

**Delivery schedules**

- Multiple active `DELIVERY` / `HANDOVER` schedules per project are allowed (multi-round delivery).
- Create requires project/order in delivery-ready state; blocked after customer confirms full delivery (`DELIVERY_SCHEDULE_NOT_ALLOWED_AFTER_COMPLETION`).

### Request delivery schedule change

`POST /project-schedules/{scheduleId}/request-change`

Customer-owned delivery schedules can request a change without directly changing authoritative time/location fields. Admin can also request on behalf of support.

```json
{
  "note": "Please deliver to address B after 15:00."
}
```

Success response data:

```json
{
  "scheduleId": "uuid",
  "status": "PENDING_CONFIRMATION",
  "customerNote": "Please deliver to address B after 15:00."
}
```

Rules:

- Only `DELIVERY` schedules are supported.
- `note` is required and saved into `customerNote`.
- Schedule status becomes `PENDING_CONFIRMATION`.
- Customer must own the project/order context; Admin bypasses ownership.
- Completed/cancelled schedules are not changeable.
- Request is rejected after delivery execution has started.

Errors: `SCHEDULE_CHANGE_NOTE_REQUIRED`, `INVALID_SCHEDULE_TYPE`, `INVALID_SCHEDULE_STATUS_TRANSITION`, `DELIVERY_IN_PROGRESS_BLOCKS_SCHEDULE_CANCEL`, `403`.

### Measurement image capture

Upload via backend multipart (same pattern as catalog/product preview). Assigned **designer** only; schedule must be `MEASUREMENT` + `CONFIRMED`. Future confirmed schedules are allowed, so FE does not need to wait until runtime to upload measurement photos.

**Request:** `multipart/form-data`

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | file | Yes | Image only: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp` |
| `visibility` | enum | No | Default `STAFF_ONLY` when omitted |
| `note` | string | No | Saved to schedule file link description |
| `projectAreaId` | uuid | No | When set, also links photo to the project area in the same request |

**Response:** `MeasurementImageUploadResponseDto`

```json
{
  "file": {
    "fileId": "uuid",
    "fileLinkId": "uuid",
    "projectId": "uuid",
    "referenceType": "PROJECT_SCHEDULE",
    "referenceId": "uuid",
    "originalFileName": "area-a.jpg",
    "fileName": "uuid.jpg",
    "fileType": "SPACE_IMAGE",
    "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
    "fileSize": 204800,
    "storagePath": "projects/{projectId}/{fileId}.jpg",
    "publicUrl": "https://...",
    "visibility": "STAFF_ONLY",
    "uploadedBy": "uuid",
    "uploadedAt": "2026-08-28T06:00:00Z"
  },
  "scheduleId": "uuid",
  "areaLink": {
    "projectAreaId": "uuid",
    "fileId": "uuid",
    "fileLinkId": "uuid"
  }
}
```

`areaLink` is `null` when `projectAreaId` was not sent.

Creates one `StoredFile` + schedule `file_links` row (`referenceType=PROJECT_SCHEDULE`, `fileType=SPACE_IMAGE`). Optional area link adds a second `file_links` row (`referenceType=PROJECT_AREA`).

One request uploads one image. For multi-select, FE sends one multipart request per file (parallel or sequential).

**Do not use** `POST /projects/{projectId}/files` with `MEASUREMENT_REPORT` for measurement photo capture — that endpoint is for general project attachments, not the measurement gallery flow.

**Link area later (optional):** if upload did not include `projectAreaId`, call `POST /project-areas/{projectAreaId}/measurement-images/{fileId}/link` (no body). Use `fileId` from upload response `file.fileId`.

**Schedule gallery query**: `projectAreaId?`, `assigned?` (filter by area link presence), `page`, `limit`

Project-wide gallery: `GET /projects/{projectId}/measurement-images` with optional `scheduleId`, `projectAreaId`, `assigned`.

### List query

`scheduleType?`, `status?`, `from?`, `to?`, `page`, `limit` (+ `projectId` on list)

### Create chat

```json
{
  "chatType": "SALES",
  "staffId": "...",
  "title": "Sales consultation"
}
```

`chatType`: `SALES`, `DESIGNER`, `DESIGNER_SALES`, `PRODUCTION`, `DELIVERY`, `GENERAL`, `INTERNAL`

`DESIGNER_SALES` is an internal Designer–Sales coordination chat (auto-created on designer assignment). **CUSTOMER** and **PRODUCTION** cannot access it.

`PRODUCTION` chat is auto-created/upserted when a production request is created or reassigned (`StaffId` = assigned production user). Assigned **SALES** and assigned **PRODUCTION** staff (matching chat `staffId`) may read/send; **CUSTOMER** and **DESIGNER** cannot access `PRODUCTION` chats.

`DESIGNER_SALES` chat is auto-created/upserted when a designer is assigned (`PATCH .../designer-assignment`). Assigned **SALES** and assigned **DESIGNER** (matching chat `staffId`) may read/send; **CUSTOMER** and **PRODUCTION** cannot access `DESIGNER_SALES` chats.

### Update status

```json
{ "status": "CLOSED" }
```

`status`: `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, `ARCHIVED`

### Send text message

```json
{
  "messageType": "TEXT",
  "content": "Hello, when can we schedule measurement?"
}
```

### Send file message (multipart)

| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | file |
| `content` | string? |
| `fileType` | `FileType` |
| `visibility` | `FileVisibility?` |

### List messages query

`page`, `limit`, `sort` (default `ASC`)

### Message response

```json
{
  "messageId": "...",
  "chatId": "...",
  "senderId": "...",
  "senderName": "Nguyen Van A",
  "senderRole": "CUSTOMER",
  "messageType": "TEXT",
  "content": "...",
  "attachment": null,
  "createdAt": "...",
  "editedAt": null,
  "deletedAt": null,
  "readAt": null
}
```

Realtime:

- Chat stream: join chat via SignalR `ProjectChatHub` (see §22). Server pushes `project_chat.message_sent` to `project:{projectId}` and `project_chat:{chatId}` groups after DB save.
- In-app notification: after a text/file message is saved, the backend also creates a notification for other chat participants and pushes `project_chat.message_sent` through `NotificationsHub` to each `user:{accountId}` receiver.
- Notification `referenceType`: `PROJECT_CHAT_MESSAGE`; `referenceId`: `messageId`.
- Notification metadata includes `chatId`, `chatType`, `messageId`, `messageType`, `senderId`, `senderName`, `projectName`, `contentPreview`. For `chatType = PRODUCTION`, metadata also includes `productionRequestId` (latest production request for the project assigned to chat `staffId`) so FE can deep-link to production request detail.

## 20a. Admin Financial Dashboard

Admin financial APIs are read-only operational dashboard endpoints. They do not mutate Payment, Order, Project, Quotation, or PaymentTransaction state.

### `GET /admin/financial/summary`

**Roles:** ADMIN

Returns collected cash and core financial obligation metrics for the requested reporting period.

#### Query

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `period` | `THIS_MONTH` / `THIS_YEAR` / `CUSTOM` | `THIS_MONTH` | Case-insensitive |
| `from` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Required when `period=CUSTOM` |
| `to` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Required when `period=CUSTOM`; date-only midnight is treated as the full local day |
| `currency` | string? | `VND` | P0 supports `VND`; unsupported values return `FINANCIAL_CURRENCY_INVALID` |

Reporting timezone is always `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`. Backend resolves local business boundaries and queries UTC timestamps using a half-open interval internally.

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Admin financial summary retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "period": {
      "type": "CUSTOM",
      "from": "2026-07-01T00:00:00+07:00",
      "to": "2026-09-30T23:59:59.9999999+07:00",
      "timezone": "Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh"
    },
    "currency": "VND",
    "collectedAmount": 0,
    "outstandingPaymentAmount": 0,
    "contractedReceivableAmount": 0,
    "orderCommercialValue": 0,
    "failedTransactionCount": 0,
    "activePaymentCount": 0
  }
}
```

#### Metric Semantics

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `collectedAmount` | Sum of actual successful canonical Payments in the period |
| `outstandingPaymentAmount` | Sum of currently active collectible Payment obligations |
| `contractedReceivableAmount` | Sum of active Order `remainingAmount`; separate from outstanding payment |
| `orderCommercialValue` | Sum of confirmed Order `finalTotalAmount` in the period; not accounting revenue |
| `failedTransactionCount` | Count of failed PaymentTransaction rows in the period |
| `activePaymentCount` | Count of currently active collectible Payment obligations |

Collected cash includes only:

- `PROJECT_START_FEE`
- `DEPOSIT`
- `REMAINING_PAYMENT`

Collected cash excludes:

- `FULL_PAYMENT`
- `REFUND`
- `OTHER`
- standalone `PaymentTransaction.SUCCESS` amounts
- `Payment.status = PAID` rows without `paidAt`

Period fields:

| Metric | Date field |
| --- | --- |
| Collected cash | `payments.paid_at` |
| Order commercial value | `orders.confirmed_at` |
| Failed transactions | `payment_transactions.created_at` |
| Outstanding payment | current-state; not period-filtered |
| Contracted receivable | current-state; not period-filtered |

#### Error Codes

| HTTP | `errorCode` | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_PERIOD_INVALID` | Unsupported `period` |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_DATE_RANGE_INVALID` | Missing custom range or `from > to` |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_CURRENCY_INVALID` | Unsupported currency |
| 401/403 | auth result | Non-admin or unauthenticated request |

### `GET /admin/financial/summary/{metric}/drilldown`

**Roles:** ADMIN. Read-only drill-down for a summary card.

- `metric`: `COLLECTED`, `OUTSTANDING`, `CONTRACTED_RECEIVABLE`, `ORDER_VALUE`, `FAILED_TRANSACTIONS`, or `ACTIVE_PAYMENTS`.
- Query: required custom range `from`, `to`; optional `currency` (currently `VND`), `projectId`, `paymentType`, `status`, `provider`, `groupBy`, `page`, `pageSize`, `sortBy`, `sortDirection`.
- `groupBy=PROJECT` is currently supported only for `COLLECTED`; its rows include customer/order totals and collection split fields. Otherwise rows identify the backing project/order/payment/transaction.
- Response: `metric`, `totalAmount`, `totalCount`, `currency`, resolved period, `breakdowns[]`, paged `items[]`.
- Errors: `FINANCIAL_METRIC_INVALID`, `FINANCIAL_GROUP_BY_INVALID`, period/currency errors, and invalid paging/filter errors.

### `GET /admin/financial/receivables`

**Roles:** ADMIN

Returns current outstanding Payment obligations and active Order receivables separately, plus paged drill-down rows for FE tables.

`GET /admin/financial/receivables/items` is also available for drill-down screens. It accepts the same query parameters and returns the same DTO shape, so FE can reuse the same table model while linking from the receivable card.

#### Query

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `keyword` | string? | null | Project/order/customer search |
| `collectionState` | string? | null | Current collection-state filter |
| `minAgeDays` / `maxAgeDays` | int? | null | Receivable age bounds |
| `projectId` | guid? | null | Filter one project |
| `customerId` | guid? | null | Filter by order customer |
| `salesId` | guid? | null | Matches `orders.sales_id` or `projects.assigned_sales_id` |
| `paymentType` | `PaymentType?` | null | When supplied, returns only orders with a matching active collectible payment |
| `paymentStatus` | `PaymentStatus?` | null | Usually `PENDING` or `PROCESSING`; only active collectible payments are considered |
| `orderStatus` | `OrderStatus?` | null | Filter active receivable orders |
| `confirmedFrom` / `confirmedTo` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Range on `orders.confirmed_at`; midnight `to` means full local day |
| `from` / `to` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Backward-compatible aliases of `confirmedFrom` / `confirmedTo` |
| `page` | int | `1` | Must be `> 0` |
| `pageSize` | int | `20` | `1..100` |
| `sortBy` | string? | `confirmedAt` | `confirmedAt`, `projectCode`, `projectName`, `orderCode`, `orderStatus`, `finalTotalAmount`, `remainingAmount` |
| `sortDirection` | string? | `desc` | `asc` or `desc` |

Date range is intentionally tied to `orders.confirmed_at` for this receivable view. Outstanding payments are resolved only for the filtered receivable orders, so the card totals and table rows remain consistent.

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Financial receivables retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "outstandingPaymentAmount": 70000000,
    "outstandingPaymentCount": 1,
    "contractedReceivableAmount": 140000000,
    "ordersWithReceivableCount": 2,
    "items": [
      {
        "projectId": "...",
        "projectCode": "PRJ-2026-0001",
        "projectName": "Cafe Interior",
        "orderId": "...",
        "orderCode": "ORD-2026-0001",
        "orderStatus": "FINAL_PAYMENT_PENDING",
        "finalTotalAmount": 100000000,
        "paidAmount": 30000000,
        "remainingAmount": 70000000,
        "activePaymentId": "...",
        "activePaymentType": "REMAINING_PAYMENT",
        "activePaymentAmount": 70000000,
        "activePaymentStatus": "PENDING",
        "isPaymentCreated": true
      }
    ],
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "totalItems": 2,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

#### Metric Semantics

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `outstandingPaymentAmount` / `outstandingPaymentCount` | Active collectible payment rows: `PENDING` / `PROCESSING`, not expired, no successful transaction |
| `contractedReceivableAmount` / `ordersWithReceivableCount` | Active orders with `remainingAmount > 0`; cancelled/completed orders are excluded by current active receivable policy |
| `isPaymentCreated` | `true` only when the order currently has an active collectible payment obligation |

Do not add `outstandingPaymentAmount` and `contractedReceivableAmount` together as a single "expected money" card. They are separate views of obligations and may refer to the same order after a remaining payment has been created.

#### Error Codes

| HTTP | `errorCode` | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_RECEIVABLE_FILTER_INVALID` | Invalid paging, sort, or date range |
| 401/403 | auth result | Non-admin or unauthenticated request |

### `GET /admin/financial/receivables/orders/{orderId}`

**Roles:** ADMIN. No body/query. Returns one receivable with order/project/customer identity, payment-progress and aging summary, all payment rounds (provider, attempts, failures), current active payment when present, and `suggestedAction`. Unknown/non-receivable order returns `404 FINANCIAL_ORDER_NOT_FOUND` with `Financial receivable order was not found.` Success message: `Financial receivable detail retrieved successfully.`

### `GET /admin/financial/payment-breakdown`

**Roles:** ADMIN

Returns collected cash, active outstanding obligations, and expired count grouped by canonical payment type.

#### Query

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `from` | DateTimeOffset | required | Reporting range start |
| `to` | DateTimeOffset | required | Reporting range end; midnight means full local day |
| `currency` | string? | `VND` | P0 supports `VND`; unsupported values return `FINANCIAL_CURRENCY_INVALID` |

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Payment breakdown retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "currency": "VND",
    "items": [
      {
        "paymentType": "PROJECT_START_FEE",
        "collectedAmount": 0,
        "paidCount": 0,
        "outstandingAmount": 0,
        "outstandingCount": 0,
        "expiredCount": 0
      },
      {
        "paymentType": "DEPOSIT",
        "collectedAmount": 0,
        "paidCount": 0,
        "outstandingAmount": 0,
        "outstandingCount": 0,
        "expiredCount": 0
      },
      {
        "paymentType": "REMAINING_PAYMENT",
        "collectedAmount": 0,
        "paidCount": 0,
        "outstandingAmount": 0,
        "outstandingCount": 0,
        "expiredCount": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Collected fields use `payments.paid_at` inside `[from, to]` after backend conversion to UTC. Outstanding fields are current active collectible payment rows. `expiredCount` counts `EXPIRED` payment rows whose `expiredAt` is inside the range.

Only canonical payment types appear:

- `PROJECT_START_FEE`
- `DEPOSIT`
- `REMAINING_PAYMENT`

`FULL_PAYMENT`, `REFUND`, `OTHER`, and standalone `PaymentTransaction.SUCCESS` amounts are excluded.

### `GET /admin/financial/collection-trend`

**Roles:** ADMIN

Returns chart-ready collected cash trend buckets. P0 supports monthly buckets only.

#### Query

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `from` | DateTimeOffset | required | Reporting range start |
| `to` | DateTimeOffset | required | Reporting range end; midnight means full local day |
| `granularity` | string? | `MONTH` | Only `MONTH` is supported |
| `currency` | string? | `VND` | P0 supports `VND` |

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Collection trend retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "granularity": "MONTH",
    "timezone": "Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh",
    "currency": "VND",
    "series": [
      {
        "period": "2026-07",
        "projectStartFee": 2000000,
        "deposit": 30000000,
        "remainingPayment": 70000000,
        "total": 102000000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Buckets are Vietnam calendar months. Backend clips the first/last month to the requested range and returns zero buckets for months without collected cash so FE can render stable charts.

#### Story 3 Error Codes

| HTTP | `errorCode` | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_DATE_RANGE_INVALID` | Missing range or `from > to` |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_GRANULARITY_INVALID` | Unsupported granularity |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_CURRENCY_INVALID` | Unsupported currency |
| 401/403 | auth result | Non-admin or unauthenticated request |

### `GET /admin/financial/projects`

**Roles:** ADMIN

Returns a paged project financial overview. This is a read-only dashboard/drill-down endpoint and does not update Project, Order, Payment, Quotation, or PaymentTransaction data.

#### Query

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `keyword` | string? | null | Searches project code, project name, or customer name |
| `projectStatus` | `ProjectStatus?` | null | Filter by current project status |
| `customerId` | guid? | null | Filter one customer |
| `salesId` | guid? | null | Filter assigned sales |
| `paymentStatus` | `PaymentStatus?` | null | Filters projects that have a matching active collectible payment |
| `paymentType` | `PaymentType?` | null | Filters projects that have a matching active collectible payment |
| `hasOrder` | bool? | null | `true` = only projects with order; `false` = only projects without order |
| `hasOutstandingPayment` | bool? | null | Uses current active collectible payment rules |
| `hasReceivable` | bool? | null | Uses active order receivable rules: active order status and `remainingAmount > 0` |
| `from` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Optional range start for `projects.created_at` |
| `to` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Optional range end for `projects.created_at`; midnight means full local day |
| `page` | int | `1` | Must be `> 0` |
| `pageSize` | int | `20` | `1..100` |
| `sortBy` | string? | `createdAt` | `createdAt`, `projectCode`, `projectName`, `projectStatus`, `orderFinalTotal`, `orderRemainingAmount`, `totalProjectCashCollected`, `lastPaidAt` |
| `sortDirection` | string? | `desc` | `asc` or `desc` |

Date filtering intentionally uses `projects.created_at` for this overview because the current schema does not have a dedicated project confirmed/financial started timestamp.

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Project financial overview retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "projectId": "...",

        "activePaymentType": "REMAINING_PAYMENT",
        "activePaymentAmount": 70000000,
        "activePaymentStatus": "PENDING",
        "totalProjectCashCollected": 32000000,
        "lastPaidAt": "2026-07-10T03:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "totalItems": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

#### Project Financial Semantics

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `projectStartFee*` | Latest project-level `PROJECT_START_FEE` payment for the project |
| `order*` | Latest order for the project by `confirmedAt`, `createdAt`, then `orderId`; nullable when no order exists |
| `activePayment*` | Latest active collectible payment: `PENDING` / `PROCESSING`, not expired, and no successful transaction |
| `totalProjectCashCollected` | Sum of canonical `PAID` payments directly on the project; excludes `FULL_PAYMENT`, `REFUND`, `OTHER`, and standalone transactions |
| `lastPaidAt` | Latest `paidAt` among canonical paid payments |

Do not compute collected cash as `projectStartFeeAmount + orderPaidAmount`. The API already returns `totalProjectCashCollected` using canonical paid Payment rows.

### `GET /admin/financial/projects/{projectId}`

**Roles:** ADMIN

Returns the same financial overview shape for one project. Nullable order/payment fields are expected when the project has not reached those workflow steps.

#### Error Codes

| HTTP | `errorCode` | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_PROJECT_FILTER_INVALID` | Invalid paging, sort, or date range on list endpoint |
| 404 | `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | Project detail does not exist |
| 401/403 | auth result | Non-admin or unauthenticated request |

### `GET /admin/financial/projects/{projectId}/statement`

**Roles:** ADMIN. Read-only ledger-style project statement.

- Query: `from`, `to`, `entryType?` (`COLLECTION`, `REFUND`, `ADJUSTMENT`), `paymentType?`, `status?`, `provider?`, `page` (default 1), `pageSize` (default 10, max 100), `sortDirection?`.
- Response: project identity; summary (`openingBalance`, `totalCollected`, `totalRefunded`, `netCollected`, `closingBalance`); paged entries with `direction` (`CREDIT`/`DEBIT`), type, references, provider/status, amount and running balance.
- Errors: `FINANCIAL_DATE_RANGE_INVALID`, `FINANCIAL_FILTER_INVALID` for entry type/paging, and `FINANCIAL_PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`. Success message: `Project financial statement retrieved successfully.`

### `GET /admin/financial/payments`

**Roles:** ADMIN

Returns a paged payment operations list with provider attempt diagnostics. This endpoint is read-only and never exposes raw provider payloads, signatures, webhook bodies, checkout secrets, or QR payload internals.

#### Query

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | guid? | null | Filter one project |
| `orderId` | guid? | null | Filter one order-linked payment |
| `customerId` | guid? | null | Filter by project customer |
| `paymentType` | `PaymentType?` | null | Example: `DEPOSIT`, `REMAINING_PAYMENT` |
| `paymentStatus` | `PaymentStatus?` | null | Payment has no fake `FAILED` status; failures are on attempts |
| `provider` | `PaymentProvider?` | null | Filters attempt provider, example `PAYOS` |
| `currency` | string? | null | Optional drill-down filter; P0 accepts `VND` when supplied |
| `createdFrom` / `createdTo` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Optional range for `payments.created_at`; midnight `to` means full local day |
| `paidFrom` / `paidTo` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Optional range for `payments.paid_at` |
| `expiredFrom` / `expiredTo` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Optional range for `payments.expired_at` |
| `hasFailedAttempt` | bool? | null | `true` = at least one failed transaction attempt; `false` = none |
| `minFailedAttemptCount` | int? | null | Must be `>= 0`; repeated failure screens usually use `2` |
| `page` | int | `1` | Must be `> 0` |
| `pageSize` | int | `20` | `1..100` |
| `sortBy` | string? | `createdAt` | `createdAt`, `paidAt`, `expiredAt`, `amount`, `paymentCode`, `status` |
| `sortDirection` | string? | `desc` | `asc` or `desc` |

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Financial payments retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "paymentId": "...",
        "paymentCode": "PAY-2026-0001",
        "projectId": "...",
        "projectCode": "PRJ-2026-0001",
        "orderId": "...",
        "orderCode": "ORD-2026-0001",
        "customerId": "...",
        "customerName": "Customer Alpha",
        "paymentType": "DEPOSIT",
        "amount": 30000000,
        "currency": "VND",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "createdAt": "2026-07-25T03:00:00Z",
        "expiredAt": "2026-07-30T03:00:00Z",
        "paidAt": null,
        "lastProvider": "PAYOS",
        "attemptCount": 2,
        "failedAttemptCount": 2,
        "lastTransactionStatus": "FAILED",
        "lastFailureReason": "Insufficient funds",
        "lastAttemptAt": "2026-07-26T03:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "totalItems": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

`lastFailureReason` is the latest failed attempt reason, not necessarily the latest transaction reason. A paid payment can still show historical failed attempts, but it is not treated as an active failure exception.

### `GET /admin/financial/exceptions`

**Roles:** ADMIN

Returns read-only operational financial exceptions for Admin attention. The endpoint does not create notification records, does not mutate Payment/Order state, and does not introduce a Payment `FAILED` lifecycle status.

#### Query

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `exceptionType` | string? | null | One of the exception types below; case-insensitive input |
| `severity` | string? | null | Example: `HIGH`, `MEDIUM` |
| `projectId` | guid? | null | Filter one project |
| `paymentType` | `PaymentType?` | null | Applies to payment-backed exceptions |
| `from` / `to` | DateTimeOffset? | null | Optional range for exception occurrence time |
| `page` | int | `1` | Must be `> 0` |
| `pageSize` | int | `20` | `1..100` |

#### Exception Types

| Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PAYMENT_EXPIRED` | Payment status is `EXPIRED` |
| `PAYMENT_REPEATED_FAILURE` | Non-paid payment has at least 2 failed transaction attempts |
| `FINAL_PAYMENT_NOT_CREATED` | Order is `FINAL_PAYMENT_PENDING`, has receivable, but no active `REMAINING_PAYMENT` |
| `DELIVERED_WITH_RECEIVABLE` | Delivered order still has `remainingAmount > 0` |
| `PAYMENT_PENDING_TOO_LONG` | Active collectible payment has stayed pending/processing beyond the operational threshold |

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Financial exceptions retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "exceptionType": "PAYMENT_REPEATED_FAILURE",
        "severity": "HIGH",
        "projectId": "...",
        "orderId": "...",
        "paymentId": "...",
        "title": "Payment has repeated failed attempts",
        "reason": "Payment has two or more failed transaction attempts.",
        "amount": 30000000,
        "age": 1,
        "occurredAt": "2026-07-26T03:00:00Z",
        "recommendedAction": "Open payment attempts and support the customer with a new checkout if needed.",
        "targetResourceType": "PAYMENT",
        "targetResourceId": "..."
      }
    ],
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "totalItems": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

#### Error Codes

| HTTP | `errorCode` | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_PAYMENT_FILTER_INVALID` | Invalid paging, sort, failed-attempt, or date filter |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_EXCEPTION_TYPE_INVALID` | Unsupported `exceptionType` |
| 401/403 | auth result | Non-admin or unauthenticated request |

### FIN-ADM-06 Reporting Hardening Notes

No new business endpoint was added for FIN-ADM-06. It hardens the existing Admin Financial endpoints:

- Financial reporting periods use explicit `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` boundaries.
- Backend resolves local business periods to UTC and queries half-open ranges: `>= fromUtc` and `< toUtc`.
- Canonical collected payment types are centralized as:
  - `PROJECT_START_FEE`
  - `DEPOSIT`
  - `REMAINING_PAYMENT`
- `FULL_PAYMENT`, `REFUND`, and `OTHER` remain excluded from collected cash metrics.
- `GET /admin/financial/payments` supports `currency=VND` so FE can reconcile card totals with paid payment drill-down rows.
- Financial indexes were added by migration `20260810143000_AddAdminFinancialDashboardIndexes`.

The added indexes target implemented query paths only:

| Index | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `idx_fin_payments_paid_reporting` | Summary, breakdown, trend, and paid payment drill-down |
| `idx_fin_payments_active_obligations` | Outstanding payment and stale pending payment checks |
| `idx_fin_payment_transactions_failed_reporting` | Failed transaction count over reporting periods |
| `idx_fin_payment_transactions_payment_failed_time` | Per-payment failed attempt diagnostics |
| `idx_fin_orders_project_confirmed` | Project financial overview latest-order lookup |
| `idx_fin_orders_receivable_status_confirmed` | Receivable and order exception scans |

---

## 20b. Admin Financial Discount Analytics

All endpoints are **ADMIN-only**, read-only projections. They do not mutate Order/Quotation discounts.

| Method | Path | Filters / request | Response purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/admin/financial/discounts/summary` | `from?`, `to?`, `currency?`, `projectStatus?`, `salesId?`, `customerId?` | Gross value, item/total discount, pre-VAT net, VAT, final value, average rate and counts |
| GET | `/admin/financial/discounts/projects` | Date/project/customer/sales, `hasDiscount?`, `minDiscountRate?`, paging/sort | Paged project/order discount rows |
| GET | `/admin/financial/discounts/orders/{orderId}` | `orderId` path | Order header discount metrics and line-item breakdown |
| GET | `/admin/financial/discounts/trend` | `from?`, `to?`, `granularity?`, `currency?`, `salesId?` | Time buckets for gross, discount, rate and counts |
| GET | `/admin/financial/discounts/exceptions` | Date, `thresholdRate?`, `thresholdAmount?`, `salesId?`, paging | High-rate/high-amount exception rows |

**Semantics**

- `grossOrderValue` is value before item discounts and VAT.
- `itemDiscountAmount`/`totalDiscountAmount` come from snapshotted Order items; this is not a recalculation from the current catalog.
- `netOrderValueBeforeVat`, `vatAmount` and `finalOrderValue` remain separate so clients do not apply VAT twice.
- Reporting timezone is `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`; supported currency follows Admin financial rules (currently `VND`).
- Exception types: `HIGH_DISCOUNT_RATE`, `HIGH_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT`.

| HTTP | Error code | Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_DISCOUNT_DATE_RANGE_INVALID` | Missing/invalid range or `from > to` |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_DISCOUNT_FILTER_INVALID` | Paging/sort/filter/threshold invalid |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_DISCOUNT_GRANULARITY_INVALID` | Unsupported trend granularity |
| 400 | `FINANCIAL_CURRENCY_INVALID` | Unsupported currency |
| 404 | `FINANCIAL_DISCOUNT_ORDER_NOT_FOUND` | Order detail does not exist |

---

## 20c. Role Dashboards (queues + KPIs)

Server-side work queues so FE can render without N+1 account lookups or client-side next-action rules. No dedicated queue tables — projections over Project / Order / ProductionRequest.

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/sales/action-queue` | SALES, ADMIN |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/sales/kpis` | SALES, ADMIN |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/designer/work-queue` | DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/designer/kpis` | DESIGNER, ADMIN |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/production/queue` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/production/kpis` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/dashboard/project-phase-deadlines` | SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/project-phase-deadlines` | SALES, DESIGNER, PRODUCTION, ADMIN |

### Common query params

| Param | Values / notes |
| --- | --- |
| `scope` | `mine` (default), `team`, `all` (`all` meaningful for ADMIN) |
| `group` | Queue tab filter (e.g. `Intake`, `Design`, `Proposal and Quotation`, `Order and Payment`, `Delivery`, `Production`) |
| `dateRange` | `today`, `thisWeek`, `thisMonth` (on derived due date; null due still included) |
| `priority` | `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW` (+ `URGENT` on Production queue) |
| `search` | Project code/name or customer name |
| `page`, `limit` | Default `1` / `20`, max `100` |
| `workType` | Production queue only: `CUSTOMIZATION_REVIEW` \| `PRODUCTION_REQUEST` \| `DELIVERY` |
| `status` | Production queue status interpreted according to `workType` |
| `dueBucket` | Production queue: `OVERDUE` \| `TODAY` \| `THIS_WEEK` \| `LATER` |

### Queue response

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "projectId": "...",
      "projectCode": "PRJ-001",
      "projectName": "...",
      "customerName": "...",
      "assigneeName": "...",
      "group": "Intake",
      "phase": "SUBMITTED",
      "status": "SUBMITTED",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "action": "Review request",
      "actionPath": "/projects/{projectId}",
      "dueAt": "2026-08-17T23:59:59Z",
      "dueBucket": "TODAY",
      "warning": null,
      "lastUpdatedAt": "..."
    }
  ],
  "countsByGroup": { "Intake": 3, "Order and Payment": 1 },
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20,
  "total": 4
}
```

`dueBucket`: `OVERDUE` | `TODAY` | `THIS_WEEK` | `LATER` (null when no due date).

Sales next-action uses project status plus latest non-cancelled order (deposit / remaining payment / delivery confirm). Designer queue is status-first for design-active work. Production queue wraps production requests, customization reviews (`scope=all`), and delivery work from `READY_FOR_DELIVERY`.

### KPI responses

**Sales:** `newRequests`, `waitingCustomer`, `paymentFollowUp`, `overdueTasks`, `activeProjects`

**Designer:** `measurementDue`, `proposalsInProgress`, `revisionRequested`, `overdueTasks`

**Production:** `pendingCustomizationReview`, `pendingStart`, `pendingReview` (alias of `pendingStart`), `inProduction`, `readyToComplete`, `overdueTasks`, `readyForDelivery`, `awaitingDeliverySchedule`, `completedInRange`. Default `scope=mine`. Customization KPI chỉ khi `scope=all`. `unavailableItems` is not a KPI field; use `GET /production-items/unavailable` for that queue.

KPI filters honor the same `scope` / `dateRange` / `search` as the queue (not page-local).

### Project phase deadline risks

Read-only dashboard endpoint for Sales/Admin/Designer/Production to see proposal and production phase timelines stored in **`project_phase_timelines`** (API route `/projects/{id}/phase-deadlines`). Does not infer deadlines from hardcoded SLA values and does not use the project-wide `targetCompletionDate` KPI. Delivery timing uses `ProjectSchedule.DELIVERY.ScheduledEnd` (queue), not `phase=DELIVERY` on this endpoint.

**Query params**

| Param | Values / notes |
| --- | --- |
| `phase` | optional `PROPOSAL` or `PRODUCTION` (`DELIVERY` → 400) |
| `status` | optional `OVERDUE`, `ON_TRACK`, `COMPLETED_ON_TIME`, `COMPLETED_LATE` |
| `salesId` | optional assigned Sales filter |
| `designerId` | optional assigned Designer filter |
| `productionId` | optional ProductionRequest assignee filter |
| `from`, `to` | optional due-date range, inclusive, `yyyy-MM-dd` |
| `page`, `limit` | default `1` / `20`, max `100` |

**Response**

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "projectId": "uuid",
      "projectCode": "PRJ-001",
      "projectName": "Coffee Shop A",
      "phase": "PROPOSAL",
      "dueDate": "2026-09-10",
      "completedAt": null,
      "projectStatus": "IN_CONSULTATION",
      "assignedSalesId": "uuid-sales",
      "assignedSalesName": "Sales One",
      "assignedDesignerId": "uuid-designer",
      "assignedDesignerName": "Designer One",
      "assignedProductionId": "uuid-production",
      "assignedProductionName": "Production One",
      "status": "OVERDUE",
      "group": "Overdue Proposal",
      "days": 3
    }
  ],
  "countsByGroup": {
    "Overdue Proposal": 1,
    "Due Soon": 2
  },
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20,
  "total": 3
}
```

`group` values: `Overdue Proposal`, `Overdue Production`, `Due Soon`, `Completed Late`, `On Track`.

`days` means days overdue for `OVERDUE`, days late for `COMPLETED_LATE`, and days remaining for `ON_TRACK` / due-soon rows.

## 21. Production

| Method | Path | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/production-requests` | PRODUCTION, SALES, ADMIN |
| GET | `/production-requests/{id}` | same |
| PATCH | `/production-requests/{id}/assign` | SALES, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/production-requests/{id}/start` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/production-requests/{id}/complete` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| PATCH | `/production-items/{id}/status` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/production-items/unavailable` | PRODUCTION, ADMIN |
| GET | `/production-staff/available` | SALES, ADMIN |

Create production request: `POST /orders/{orderId}/production-request` (§13).

### List query

`projectId?`, `status?`, `assignedTo?`, `priority?`

### Assign

```json
{
  "assignedTo": "...",
  "assignmentNote": "Priority batch"
}
```

### Start

Optional body (ignored for date assignment — server sets `actualStartDate` to UTC today on start):

```json
{ "actualStartDate": "2026-08-05" }
```

### Update production item status

```json
{
  "status": "IN_PRODUCTION",
  "productionNote": "Cutting",
  "cancellationReason": null
}
```

`ProductionItemStatus`: `PENDING`, `IN_PRODUCTION`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`  
`ProductionRequestStatus`: `PENDING`, `IN_PRODUCTION`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`

Production request lifecycle is `PENDING -> IN_PRODUCTION -> COMPLETED`. New production requests are created as `PENDING`; `PATCH /production-requests/{id}/start` accepts only `PENDING` requests and moves them to `IN_PRODUCTION`. The previous production request `mark-feasible` step is removed from normal API flow because feasibility review belongs to customization production review.

When completing production, each item must be `COMPLETED` or `CANCELLED`. Cancelled production items map the linked order item to **`UNAVAILABLE`** (with `unavailableReason` from production cancellation) — no order financial adjustment is required. Server sets `actualCompletionDate` on complete.

### Available staff query

`projectId?`, `productionRequestId?`, `search?`

**Response item:** `accountId`, `fullName`, `email`, `avatarUrl?`, `accountStatus`, request counts, `isAvailable`

### Unavailable production items

`GET /production-items/unavailable` is a read-only PRODUCTION/ADMIN queue of cancelled production items mapped to unavailable Order items.

- Query: `keyword?`, `assignedTo?`, `page` (default 1), `pageSize` (default 20, max 100).
- Item: `productionItemId`, `productionRequestId/code`, project/order IDs and codes, assignee, `orderItemId`, product/version snapshots, quantity, status, `cancellationReason`, `completedAt`.
- Invalid paging returns `400` with `PRODUCTION_INVALID_QUERY` and message `Production unavailable items pagination is invalid.` Success message: `Unavailable production items retrieved successfully.`

### Completion response

`ProductionCompletionDto`: `productionRequestId`, `productionStatus`, `orderStatus`, `projectStatus`, `actualStartDate?`, `actualCompletionDate?`, `readyOrderItemCount`, `unavailableOrderItemCount`, `finalTotalAmount`, `paidAmount?`, `remainingAmount?`

---

## 22. SignalR hubs

| Hub | Path | Auth | Client methods |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NotificationsHub | `/hubs/notifications` | JWT | Auto-join `user:{accountId}`, `role:{ROLE}` |
| ProjectChatHub | `/hubs/project-chat` | JWT | `JoinProject`, `LeaveProject`, `JoinChat`, `LeaveChat` |
| PaymentHub | `/hubs/payments` | CUSTOMER, SALES, DESIGNER, ADMIN | `JoinPayment`, `LeavePayment` |

### Token sources

| Source | REST | notifications / project-chat | payments hub |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization: Bearer` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cookie `access_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `?access_token=` | — | ✓ | Not wired in `IsRealtimeHubPath` |

Negotiate example:

```text
GET /hubs/notifications/negotiate?negotiateVersion=1
```

Hub behavior here is derived from the current hub classes, authorization setup and realtime dispatch services.

### Chat notification event

`project_chat.message_sent` is emitted on both hubs with different purposes:

| Hub | Receiver | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/hubs/project-chat` | joined `project:{projectId}` / `project_chat:{chatId}` groups | live chat thread refresh |
| `/hubs/notifications` | direct `user:{accountId}` groups | notification bell / unread notification UI |

Notification title: `New chat message`  
Notification message: `{SenderName} sent a new message in "{ChatTitle}".`

### Payment realtime payload (typical)

`PaymentUpdatedRealtimeDto`: `paymentId`, `projectId`, `paymentCode`, `status?`, `amount`, `paidAmount`, `remainingAmount`, `paymentTransactionId`, `transactionAmount`, `appliedAmount`, `paidAt?`, `occurredAt`

---

## 23. Portfolio & public showcases

Portfolio showcases are separate from generic project files. One showcase per project; workflow: `DRAFT → PENDING_REVIEW → PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED`.

- `projectAddress` — `Project.ProjectAddress`
- `completionYear` — `Project.CompletedAt.Year`
- `coverUrl` — cover `ProjectShowcaseMedia` (`isCover=true`) file URL

Only showcases with status **`PUBLISHED`** appear on public endpoints.

**Error codes**: `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_NOT_FOUND`, `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_ALREADY_EXISTS`, `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_SLUG_DUPLICATE`, `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION`, `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_PROJECT_NOT_COMPLETED`, `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_PUBLISH_REQUIREMENTS_NOT_MET`, `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_FILE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_FEATURED_REVIEW_INVALID`, `PROJECT_REVIEW_CONSENT_FORBIDDEN`, `PROJECT_SHOWCASE_COVER_CONFLICT`

### Project showcase current behavior update

This section supersedes the older showcase notes above where they differ.

**Internal project tab**

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/projects/{projectId}/showcase` | SALES, ADMIN | Creates one DRAFT showcase only when project status is `COMPLETED` |
| GET | `/projects/{projectId}/showcase` | SALES, ADMIN | Reads the showcase attached to a project |

**Create/update content**

New FE should use `introduction`; backend stores it in `project_showcases.description`.

```json
{
  "introduction": "A warm minimalist cafe interior completed for a boutique coffee brand."
}
```

Legacy `title`, `summary`, and `description` are still accepted for backward compatibility. `title` defaults from `Project.ProjectName` when omitted.

**Workflow**

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PATCH | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}` | SALES, ADMIN | Sales can edit only `DRAFT`; Admin can edit `DRAFT`, `PENDING_REVIEW`, `PUBLISHED` |
| PATCH | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/submit` | SALES, ADMIN | Validates project completed, non-empty introduction, at least one media, and one cover |
| PATCH | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/publish` | ADMIN | Revalidates the same publish requirements |
| PATCH | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/reject` | ADMIN | Moves `PENDING_REVIEW` back to `DRAFT`; no `REJECTED` status is used |
| PATCH | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/archive` | ADMIN | Moves `PUBLISHED` to `ARCHIVED`; archived showcases are read-only |

If introduction is missing during submit/publish, response code is `SHOWCASE_INTRODUCTION_REQUIRED`.

**Media**

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/media` | SALES, ADMIN | Multipart upload. Creates `StoredFile`, `FileLink(PORTFOLIO_IMAGE)`, and `ProjectShowcaseMedia` atomically |
| POST | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/media/upload` | SALES, ADMIN | Backward-compatible upload alias |
| POST | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/media/from-file` | SALES, ADMIN | Adds showcase media from an existing active project file |
| PATCH | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/media/{mediaId}/cover` | SALES, ADMIN | Sets the single cover media |
| PATCH | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/media/reorder` | SALES, ADMIN | Reorders all showcase media |
| DELETE | `/project-showcases/{showcaseId}/media/{mediaId}` | SALES, ADMIN | Deletes only showcase media row; if cover is removed, next media by display order is promoted |

Sales can manage media only while `DRAFT`. Admin can manage media in `DRAFT`, `PENDING_REVIEW`, and `PUBLISHED`. Cover is determined only by `ProjectShowcaseMedia.IsCover == true`.

**Admin management**

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/admin/project-showcases` | ADMIN | Internal showcase list |
| GET | `/admin/project-showcases/{showcaseId}` | ADMIN | Internal showcase detail with project data, introduction, media, and cover |

Admin list query: `search`, `status`, `businessType`, `page` default `1`, `pageSize` default `20` max `100`, `sort` default `updatedAt_desc`.

**Public portfolio**

`GET /public/showcases` supports `search`, `businessType`, `sort`, `page`, `pageSize`. Supported sort values: default newest completed date, `completedDate_asc`, `area_asc`, `area_desc`.

Public list primary fields for FE: `projectShowcaseId`, `slug`, `projectName`, `businessType`, `completedDate`, `totalAreaSqm`, `coverUrl`.

`GET /public/showcases/{slug}` primary fields for FE: `projectShowcaseId`, `slug`, `projectName`, `introduction`, `businessType`, `completedDate`, `numberOfFloors`, `implementationDurationDays`, `projectAddress`, `completionYear`, `totalAreaSqm`, `coverUrl`, `media`.

Only `PUBLISHED` showcases are public. Public media comes only from curated `ProjectShowcaseMedia`; project files, production files, quotation files, and internal files are not exposed through portfolio endpoints.

## Appendix B — Typical end-to-end flow (customer project)

```text
1. POST /auth/register → verify-email → cookies
2. POST /projects
3. Sales: PATCH .../sales-assignment → consultation / info requests
4. Sales: PATCH .../designer-assignment (after start fee if required)
5. Designer: POST proposals → scenes → PUT room-planner → sync items → publish
6. Customer: PATCH proposals/{id}/select-final → draft quotation auto-created (`quotationId` in response)
7. Sales: PATCH quotations/{id} (validUntil, depositAmount) → PATCH send
8. Customer: PATCH quotations/{id}/accept → Order **CREATED** (deposit snapshotted, not collected yet)
9. POST orders/{id}/payments/deposit → order **DEPOSIT_PENDING** → POST /api/payments/{id}/transactions (or SePay/PayOS helpers)
10. Provider webhook → PAID → order/project side effects
11. (Optional before deposit paid) POST projects/{id}/reopen-proposal → back to PROPOSAL_CONSULTING
12. Sales: POST production-request → production lifecycle
13. POST /orders/{id}/deliveries (partial batches) or PATCH .../complete-delivery (legacy full batch) → customer confirm-delivery → remaining payment
```

## Appendix C — Admin Project Attention Reports

Controller: `AdminProjectReportsController` · **ADMIN only** · read-only.

| Method | Path | Request | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/admin/project-reports` | Query filters/paging/sort below | Paged attention rows |
| GET | `/admin/project-reports/{projectId}` | `projectId` path | Stage health, flow progress, commercial and terminal snapshots |

**List filters:** `keyword?`, `stage?`, `projectStatus?`, `attentionReason?`, `severity?`, `ownerRole?`, `salesId?`, `designerId?`, `attentionOnly` (default `true`), `minAgeDays?`, `from?`, `to?`, `page` (default 1), `pageSize` (default 20), `sortBy` (default `severityDesc`), `sortDirection` (default `desc`).

**List row:** project/customer/assignee identity, `stage`, `ageDays`, `ageInStatusDays`, `attentionReason`, `suggestedAction`, `ownerRole`, `severity`, `submittedAt`.

**Detail flow:** read-only projection; it does not update Project or create tasks/notifications. `currentStageHealth` contains state, blockers, next action and deep links; `flowProgress` returns stage states; `commercialSnapshot` returns fee/order/payment totals; terminal projects can include completion/rejection summary.

| HTTP | Error code | Message/case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `PROJECT_REPORT_FILTER_INVALID` | Invalid date, paging, stage, severity, owner, attention or sort filter |
| 404 | `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | Detail project does not exist |

## Appendix E — Coverage and maintenance notes

### Controller/action coverage evidence

Source inventory performed against every `.cs` file under `src/FurniSpace.API/Controllers`:

- **56 controller files**
- **292 controller actions**
- **296 HTTP attribute route variants**
- The four additional variants are aliases on project-area create, project-schedule create, showcase media upload, and project phase-deadline dashboard.

The domain route tables above cover all 292 actions. Both aliases are shown where one action has two route attributes. The audit also checked action-level authorization before class-level authorization, so `ADMIN` is listed only where the source attribute includes it. Route constraints such as `:guid`/`:int` are server matching constraints; client-facing tables retain the same parameter name and type in the surrounding contract.

- Prefer this doc + live `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` when fields drift; DTO source of truth is `src/FurniSpace.Application/DTOs` (report models also in `src/FurniSpace.Shared/DTOs/Reports`).
  2190|- Routing is intentionally inconsistent in a few places (`/api/Accounts` vs `/accounts/...`, `/api/ProductVersions` vs `/ProductVersions`); paths above match controllers as coded.
- `AccountsController` CRUD currently lacks `[Authorize]` — treat as a security gap until locked down.
- Auth tokens are cookie-first; JSON body does not include raw access/refresh tokens.
- For deeper behavior, follow the current payment/realtime/planner/storage source; `docs/backend-api-dev-guide.md` is secondary context only.
